Now that my life has returned to normal after the chaos from last week, I decided I needed to hunker down and get back to the grind of my daily workout. I slacked a lot last week. In fact, I only walked one day with Megan. That was the only exercise I got all week, aside from chasing after three kids, of course.
You can add between 5 to 10 drops of essential oil to your homemade laundry detergent if you prefer your laundry soap scented (essential oil ideas: lavender, rosemary, tea tree oil). I really enjoy the clean smell of the fels naptha.

Discipline in schools is important to ensure a positive learning environment for all. I think clear, applicable, and relevant policies outlining behaviors and consequences is one way to ensure students and teachers feel safe to learn. These policies should be school (and perhaps even district) wide, applied consistently, and be fair to all students. Every student has the right to learn in a safe and secure environment and teachers deserve to teach in safe and secure schools.
Unbelievably, Princess Miss M was found as a stray. The same Miss M who has a slew of sweaters because she can't stand the cold, who can't let her dainty feet step in puddles, an who needs to bring out her fuzzy rug and fluffy pillow to lay outdoors. Here she is"Glamping":

I had never heard of the designation CODA (Child of Deaf Adult) until after I moved away from home and saw the Hallmark movie “Love is Never Silent.” In the movie, there’s a confrontational scene between the deaf parents and the hearing daughter after she’s moved away from home. During that scene, I broke down and sobbed like I’d never cried in all my life. In fact, I couldn’t even talk about that movie for a couple of years without starting to cry. I wasn’t angry with my parents. Nor do I think I had an unlucky childhood. That movie began a process which helped me learn how important it is that I embrace who I am. I am in both worlds, both deaf and hearing. My personality is different in each world. When I sign to deaf people I’m no longer shy. If I see a deaf person signing, I want to go over and introduce myself. In the hearing world, I’m much more reserved. Since then, I’ve learned to recognize that I can live in both worlds at the same time.

I say ‘my’. In fact, I suspect this is something we’ve all had to begrudgingly figure out at some point or other, regardless of the bullshit behind it being lower-cased or title-cased. I suppose it’s just that, with the big-B’d Bullshit, finding yourself ribbon-tangled in a number of hugely conflicting emotions at any one time is less an occasional nuisance of a lesson learned than a baffling mindfuck of a rammed-down-your-throat crash-course exam-retake in genetics from a Klingon-speaking Amy Childs.

Max Tegmark, astrophysicist, cosmologist and professor in the physics faculty at MIT in Cambridge, Mass likes the idea of parallel universes: the quantum mechanics (QM) paradox of a particle’s ability to be in two places at the same time. He sees mathematics as our ultimate connection to reality. “Math is not something we invented, but something we are continually rediscovering.”

Hi! My name is Dash and I’ve had 5 months of practice writing a blog. Now that I am in a better place in my life I have decided to take a leap and start my professional blog, in which I wish to learn more about myself. This task was prescribed by my good friend Julie, on my birthday, and I feel like this is useful advice. Here I hope to dig deeper into my hobbies, interests, and whatever else I may find buried along the way, now that I can somewhat concentrate on my life.
This lasted for a few moments before she came back to her senses. She then pulled her coat around her and stood to leave. The pigeon hopped politely to one side. She hadn't even noticed me. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, people rarely do. My teeth ground together as I felt the anger rising in me. I watched her leave, and made a split second decision to head after her. I hung back a bit, I didn't want her to notice me now. Not yet anyway.

2) Produce Truck! A few days ago, I saw a produce truck in my neighborhood. I’ve never seen before, although they’re catching on in cities across the country. I read an article about one in Detroit a few years back, and thought it was a great idea. Basically, vendors sell produce out of the back of a truck (like ice cream), driving around neighborhoods where residents don’t have easy access to fresh, healthy food, usually due of a lack of grocery stores. My neighborhood isn’t lacking in supermarkets (there are three within walking distance of my place, and two of them have low produce prices), but it’s a concept that I think is wonderful, so when I saw the truck a few days ago, I decided to stop and buy something from it the next time I saw it.

Endings. Again, like The House of the Devil - which I'm constantly comparing to as it's such an awesome movie - The Innkeepers somewhat challenges its audience. Did it really happen? I know of people who read the ending of The House of the Devil as a possible “dream state/imaginary” space as to say that the movie never really happened… strange yes, and I do not really agree with it either, but at the same time, I definitely feel that The Innkeepers does pose similar questions. Did it really happen or was it in the state of fear and confusion that brought it all on? The last shot lingers on for an eternity before presenting the answer. And I also find that last scene to be part of the intelligent narrative that West uses in The Innkeepers. It's not to unlike the viral video that was seen earlier. He builds to a climax with the exact same tricks that the viral video does. And this is a motif that I find runs vibrantly though the movie. Is it real or all just a trick? During the last half hour, I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a scene where Claire wakes up and it all had been a dream. Now this doesn’t happen obviously, but in some strange way there’s a feeling that it could have happened in the last act.
Dear Adventure Journal-
The dialogue delivery was a pain all through the movie. Dev Patel was an eye sore and the Bollywood style romance with Frieda Pinto seemed utterly out of place. Everything he did rang hollow: every piece of dialogue, every bit of action, everything. Let us be honest. Dev Patel would not last five minutes in a Mumbai slum. It all seemed fictitious and unbelievable to me.

After having her throat hemorrhage surgery in November, Adele was advised to take time off her singing career which she says it helped to regain a perspective on her career: “It was so fast-paced I could hardly ever remember the bulk of my day. I think I just needed to be silenced. And when you are silent, everyone around you is silent. So the noise in my life just stopped. It was like floating in the sea for the weeks. It was brilliant.”

Democrats delivered for unions by exempting the first $27,500 of a straight family’s health plan from the “Cadillac tax” and delayed any taxation on those benefits until 2018. Gay individuals, parents and their children who receive their health insurance through their domestic partners pay income tax on dollar one of their benefits. This is a huge disparity in the treatment of gays and straights. It is also a hardship for middle and low-income gay families and an injustice for all gays. Lobbying to include domestic partners in the “Cadillac tax” exemption would have been smart, non-controversial and helped many in our community. Instead of making progress, by ignoring this opportunity we were left with the expansion of a discriminatory system.

ROFLMBO!! I'm finally getting around to posting this pic (kinda forgot about this, I mean her birthday was December). Ever have one of those days (or months!) where you just kind of lose all track of time...I kept saying I'd post this but, oh well, better late than never (i think that's my life's mantra, LOL). I sent her the card along with a great little insulated lunch bag! I found the bag at Stein-mart around Christmas and immediately thought about my Sis (oh did I mention, she's MUCH older than me!!).
Also, I know that a couple of people asked me to keep them posted on how the zine was going, so I'll give a litle update on that!

I've actually received 5 different things from 3 different people, and am hoping to get more stuff soon... ;-) So that's going well.

This book discusses the animal zodiac and tries to explain some of the different animals. Ahead of time, I check to see which year each child was born (you think they would know, but many don't!).

Then there's the stuff that isn't about hitting -- Cameron was a much faster and better base runner -- he stole almost 300 bases in his career, and he scored runs at about the same rate as Rice even though he hit 100 fewer home runs one his career.

“Where are you from?” I asked. He told me he was from Turkey and what his academic interests were. He then asked me where I was from and where I went to school.

He repeated what I said for clarification; I confirmed it; and his response was, “That’s strange.”

In a preview of an upcoming episode from ABC’s program, What Would You Do?, an irritated diner patron comes to the aid of a waitress being verbally harassed by another customer. The waitress ins questions, is a real transgender woman but the verbally-abusive customer is an actor. The program puts forth an interesting scenario, and one that I’m sure plays out more and more often, and it’s great to see someone standing up for the woman, who is, indeed, just trying to do her job. Interestingly, when the actor asks the irritated patron if he thinks it’s “ok for someone to be disgusting,” the patron replies, “It’s okay to be whoever you want to be. This is America.”

We went ringing at Al Ali Farm in the afternoon last weekend. I had only been ringing at this site once before and it looks like a great site. There are plenty of tall trees, shrubs and open fields and a lot of birds where about. In the trees we set three nets hoping to catch Rufous-tailed Scrub Robin and Common Redstart which were seen in good numbers as we were setting up the nets. We also hoped we could catch a few Ortolan buntings in the grass field as Brendan and Nicole had caught 21 birds there the weekend before in one attempt. As it turned out most of the Ortolan Buntings had moved on and plenty of House Sparrows were in the fields along with a number of Daurian Shrikes and Turkestan Shrikes. Abdulla came for an hour and hoped to catch a Lesser Grey Shrike that he had seen but it evaded the trap and was not caught. …

I could feel my brain boiling in its fluid by the time I found a way to the beach. But I still had to drag my cycle across the sand, now that we’d come this far, it had to see the sea as well. It is hard work dragging a cycle in the sand but I got it there and headed for one of the shacks. Putting the stand on one of my chappals in the shade, I stood staring at the sea, taking it all in, for a long moment before finally settling down into a chair and ordering a large lunch.

Back from Portland, and into the stream of consciousness that comes from sitting in an empty pub doing cleaning, maintenance and paperwork. A Subway sub and half pint of mild for lunch, a quick foray into the current blogroll (thanks again, Jeff - we need to open a proper real ale pub in Stumptucky), and some thoughts about spending some time in the city with the most breweries than any city in the world.

Well Quinn was really celebrating last night. We went to Dave and Buster's and then home to watch movies. She decided this was the time to torment Belvedere, our beagle. I have never seen her so motivated and strong, trying to get to him and be by him despite Belvedere's lack of reciprocal interest in this interaction. It took both Riley and myself to play defense against her with Belvedere on my lap. Riley got his glasses ripped of and the brunt of Quinn's force. How in the world has Quinny gotten so strong? Gee - it is like she is a superhero or something. One with more flexibility than any other (she can do splits over the enemy). One that is obsessed with beagle dogs and being by them. Don't let her fool you with her cuteness. She is one tough cookie. Happy New Year everyone!

If you can imagine your muscular engagement as a dial, practice your engagement at different levels of engagement. Try about a 3, then dial it up to a 7; try a 10 (completely engaged) then dial your engagement back to a 1 or a 2. Practice these different levels to become familiar with the amount of effort it takes to engage. Why? Because you don't need to dial up your engagement to a 10 if you are only picking up a water bottle. But what if you are picking up a toddler or a heavy rock? Then you need more muscular engagement.

Kapil Sibbal, Union Minister for HRD, said, “India is seeing rapid economic activity and growth. Developing India’s youth and their skills is going to play an important role in the country’s inclusive growth. The union budget also laid emphasis on skill development and so does the proposed 12th Five Year Plan with a National Policy on Skill development. The PPP model (public-private partnership) is most essential in running and managing training institutions to address the skill gap most efficiently. Microsoft’s commitment to empower students by deploying Microsoft Live@edu for 7.5 million users across the country with AICTE is commendable and a step towards an informed and developing India. I congratulate both AICTE and Microsoft on this significant milestone.”
To get just a small idea of God’s creative power, let us consider our corner of the universe. We live on one of nine planets that revolve around the sun. As the dominant light of our solar system, our sun gives off far more energy in one second than all mankind has produced since creation. With a diameter of approximately 860,000 miles, the sun could hold one million planets the size of the Earth. Yet our sun is only an average-size star.

Back to the 10/14/05 article Times article, which cites public relations efforts without any room for criticism of them:
Firstly, the leader, Suho had been a trainee in SM Entertainment for 7 years before debuting. He has seen some of his juniors debut before him and he was deeply hurt every time it happened.
On Saturday 07 April 2012 as previously mentioned briefly in this post (so this is sort of a repeat/recap), I received a package of 2011 Allen & Ginter Minis from Nick at Dime Boxes. I had sent him about 50 Vladimir Guerrero cards from Vlad's Expos years (a "Vlading" as it were it in reference to "Bipping" except I didn't send multiple duplicates, I think I only sent one dupe) and in the brotherly Trading Card Universe way he returned in kind, minus the Bipping er Vlad-ing by sending me 20 A&G Minis. I'll repeat the list of goodies and then highlight a few of them front and back.

The annual Nude campaign that Marie Claire has grown quite famous for over the years, wherein a handful of cause-inspired, famous South Africans in the fields of entertainment and business amongst others, communicate their ideologies so bravely, in support of the notion of respect for the human (and animal) entity – with a mega focus on the body, raising deep rooted issues, funds and ultimately, AWARENESS.

The windows, garage, the way it’s very low. I almost get nostalgic seeing this. One weird thing is that American people all speak Japanese though. This always kind of annoys me. The only anime I’ve seen who really got this right was Higashi no Eden and I give a lot of credit to them for it.
Across the hallway is the fabric-covered cork board. We used a mirror that was a gift from my MIL and turned it into this corkboard. This was the first cork board I ever did and I didn’t research it very well thinking it looked pretty straightforward. But after putting it all together the tacks didn’t stay in, so in my ignorance I bought more cork board thinking it just needed another layer. They stay in a little bit better but not great. I definitely recommend cutting a piece of cardboard to put behind cork boards like we did in the office.
Stained glass art can also be appreciated for how the artist may present the story in each glass “frame” to draw in the viewer. At times, the frame is just a reflective chapter of a larger stained glass artwork narrative.
A recent study by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has confirmed 1988 as a “change point” in the rise of Autism Disorder rates in the U.S. – a date that pro-life leaders say correlates with the introduction of fetal cells for use in vaccines.
THE rich world’s troubles and inequalities have been making headlines for some time now. Yet a more important story for human welfare is the persistence of yawning gaps between the world’s haves and have-nots. Adjusted for purchasing power, the average American income is 50 times that of a typical Afghan and 100 times that of a Zimbabwean. Despite two centuries of economic growth, over a billion people remain in dire poverty.

Thankfully the cold spell has relented and Friday will see the brewery fired up for the first time in 2012. My only reservations are that I'm out for a few beers on the Thursday evening, so I might well have a sore head when the time comes to switch on the HLT, which will be pretty early as I like to get finished while there's still daylight. The second reservation is the pump.
After I organized Apple's closet, Gwyneth loved it so much, that she contacted her good buddy Oprah to tell her about it. Oprah was so impressed that she decided to do a feature on it in her magazine. She also asked me to organize her shoe room. I did that for 100,000 and she was so thrilled with it she tried to kiss me full on the mouth, before her bodyguard had the audacity to tackle ME to the ground, breaking my arm.
Since being practically forced into doing a bold lip everyday for work, I've fallen in love with lipstick so much that I continue to do bold lip looks on my days off! I could very easily go months without doing a bold eyeshadow look, but then my blog would be reallllly boring. Thankfully I have quite a few dramatic eye looks backlogged that I can post :)
I say ‘my’. In fact, I suspect this is something we’ve all had to begrudgingly figure out at some point or other, regardless of the bullshit behind it being lower-cased or title-cased. I suppose it’s just that, with the big-B’d Bullshit, finding yourself ribbon-tangled in a number of hugely conflicting emotions at any one time is less an occasional nuisance of a lesson learned than a baffling mindfuck of a rammed-down-your-throat crash-course exam-retake in genetics from a Klingon-speaking Amy Childs.

In candolim, I cycled first to the apartments, where mum would arrive later in the evening, where I would come eventually to surprise her, and left a little birthday note (it was her birthday) and then headed for the beach. I could feel my brain boiling in its fluid by the time I found a way to the beach. But I still had to drag my cycle across the sand, now that we’d come this far, it had to see the sea as well. It is hard work dragging a cycle in the sand but I got it there and headed for one of the shacks. Putting the stand on one of my chappals in the shade, I stood staring at the sea, taking it all in, for a long moment before finally settling down into a chair and ordering a large lunch. I’d left home with a little less than 500 bucks, and now, four days later (and much thanks to Suji) I had about

Well, I’ll tell you the truth: it beats me! However, I’m not ashamed to admit that Stan Madeley is my kind of man: fearless when the circumstances call for it but with a dash of the romantic when his wife Sandra (54) hits the dimmer switch. He’s also the UK’s top Richard Madeley lookalike and a trained cabaret chisel thrower to boot, so you don’t need me to point out that he’s blessed on more than one front.

Sport brings about a whole new meaning behind the value of food! I would argue that as an athlete, the preparation and consumption of food can take up to half of our entire day. I have come to appreciate the value that proper nutrition can have on body composition, performance and confidence. Two years ago, I weighed in at a rather staggering amount. I was boggled by the continual growth (bad kind of growth) on the scale week after week as I felt that my diet had an awful lot of spinach and not enough ice-cream. In September 2010, I was about 20 pounds heavier than what I targeted my ideal racing weight to be. Imagine skating, sliding, jumping, running, simply living with a 20lb sac of potatoes on your back – kinda’ an inconvenience. So with this thought in mind (and motivated by the fact that my cyclist brother (4” taller than me) weighed the same) I was determined to figure out how to mash this sac of potatoes and become a healthy, lean machine.

Stan might also be making the connection that his mafia friends are not so friendly after all. This season has been better so far with the exception of us following the politician, which is a bit boring. I’m assuming he must still be connected in some way, perhaps his rival will be linked to it all, and he will be involved in uncovering it, thus redeeming his professional reputation.

I founded Naadyn (old bandname Tape3000) in 2007. All songs are written and produced by myself. I started to learn some programs and composed melodies with a synthesizer (Microkorg). Over the years my music changed and I finally found what my sound should be like. I still record melodies, work a lot to find the right arrangement and add my voice. But the way how I produce my songs is basically the same: Sitting in my room, dim light, a computer and a synthesizer, some chocolate, three cats and a night that becomes a day.
There were half a million fewer whites in California in 2008 than in 2000, a period when the state's overall population grew by 4 million to 38.1 million, according to a study released Thursday by the state Department of Finance.
Since my Washington, D.C. address and the writing of this article, I conducted two vitally important pieces of research work on Dr. Bob and his younger years in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. First, my son and I visited St. Johnsbury, Vermont twice over a total period of three weeks. We were able to find literally thousands of relevant records, manuscripts, books, sermons, teachings, newspapers articles, and other writings that showed the immense Christian upbringing Dr. Bob had as a youngster in Vermont. His upbringing involved the Great Awakening of 1875 which preceded his birth but impacted on the entire community of St. Johnsbury. It involved his Congregationalist parents and their indoctrination of Bob with facts about salvation and the Word of God. It involved the North Congregational Church of St. Johnsbury, Vermont where the entire Smith family attended church services at least 4 times each week. The father was a Deacon, a member of the Executive Committee, and a Sunday school teacher. The mother helped write a history of the church, headed its Christian education program, sang in the choir, and was active in many church activities. The Young Men’s Christian Association, as well as the Young People’s Society of Christian Endeavor, played a major role in the church; and the YMCA, of which Bob’s father was President, was also active in St. Johnsbury Academy which Dr. Bob attended.

Even if we didn't have the HRA, we would still be a signatory to the ECHR, and it's very difficult to see how they would get around this, but one effect of scrapping the HRA would be that the only way HR breaches could be remedied would be by the European Court of Human Rights - and this is a remedy that is very time and labour consuming - not to mention way too intimidating for most pro-bono/legal aid lawyers, who usually take breaches to the UK courts (with the ECtHR being at the top of the appeals process).

We see this in Hebrews 10:19-22, where we are encouraged to come near to God in “the house of God” through the torn “veil” of the broken “flesh”, and through the shed blood, which is “sprinkled” (cp. 9:21) on our hearts, of Christ the “High Priest”. It is impossible to exclude the Eucharist from our interpretation of this passage, especially since this entrance into “the Holiest” is said to be a “new and living way”, while the Eucharist, which also happens in the house of God, the Church, is called the “new covenant”.
Yet, there were other early influences in my father’s life, ones that spoke of need and want. Born in 1918, he went through the Depression as a young man, and knew hunger and hardship first hand. While my mother regaled my sisters and I with stories of simple Christmases on her childhood farm in rural New York State, my father kept silent. Only later, when I was an adult, did he share the truth of having had little or nothing.

In a preview of an upcoming episode from ABC’s program, What Would You Do?, an irritated diner patron comes to the aid of a waitress being verbally harassed by another customer. The waitress ins questions, is a real transgender woman but the verbally-abusive customer is an actor. The program puts forth an interesting scenario, and one that I’m sure plays out more and more often, and it’s great to see someone standing up for the woman, who is, indeed, just trying to do her job. Interestingly, when the actor asks the irritated patron if he thinks it’s “ok for someone to be disgusting,” the patron replies, “It’s okay to be whoever you want to be. This is America.”

Since we just talked about building relationships and discussed some aspects of the communication principles let’s dig a little deeper to see how they relate to what I call verbal art. Every artist has their own style and way of expressing their artistic abilities. As a salesperson we have to understand that our art form often comes through our ability to paint a picture with our words. People who get in to sales as a career usually have a history of being smooth talkers and understand the principles I am outlining instinctually. By reading this book and implementing these principles in your every day life you can become just as effective a salesperson. It just takes practice.

After that the humorous and alliterative credits became more infrequent. Indeed, Stan often saved that for the Bullpen Bulletin or the letters page.

He repeated what I said for clarification; I confirmed it; and his response was, “That’s strange.”

So, there we have it. I was sad that the sea horse and star fish and lighthouse cookie cutters had not arrived in time for this batch...but I'll be attempting those when I next get the hankerin' to bake and decorate sugar cookies. This seems to be the season...It starts with Christmas, segues into Valentine's Day (which I skipped this year in the cookie department) and then we have Spring Break and Easter. After that, I probably won't do any for a while. Maybe until 4th of July...and then, of course, I have a lot of humidity to deal with so...we'll see!

As we were leaving the appointment we received an awesome, unexpected blessing. I had already climbed into the backseat of the car with Nora. William was about to get in when a woman parked next to us rolled down her window. “Excuse me,” she said, “I just wanted to let you know that we’ve been praying for you!” She had never met us, only recognized us from the blog, yet boldly decided to speak out. By doing so she completely made our day! We had permanent smiles etched on our faces at yet another example of just how many lives little Nora has touched. Thank you, Jennifer for your courage in saying something to us and for praying for us! That was awesome!

Surprise’s are fun sometimes, no? I was really happy that the fact that Naughty Dog has been working on The Last of Us for a good 18 months never got out there. I guess I can now say that when I intervewed there in spring 2010, the second team building was on it’s way I think. There’s so little surprises in the videogames industry as rumours are usually 99% of the time true. I think for many of us the first reaction was that man, this end of the world zombie stuff is played out and I feel that, but on the other hand, if Naughty Dog are going for real survival horror and building relationships between the key characters, that’s something that really hasn’t been done very well at all in the last few years.

It took them rather longer, looking back, than one might have expected, but they obviously thought very hard, particularly after the second summer, 2007, and said, "We're not going to get anywhere taking on the British soldiers at what they do best; ergo we will find another way".
If we want our children to be lateral problem solvers now and later, we need to PLAY! We adults also need to learn to play again. instead of sitting inside the fence of limitations feeling frustrated, we need to look for the gate or just build one. It's easier to find the gate if we're in the flow of "bliss energy". We don't have to aim for happiness, though. We just need to know we can EXPAND if we want or need to.

They say in AA that the first step is admitting that you have a problem. I’ve never been to AA but I have to think they must be right. It seems pretty obvious. After all, you can’t exactly fight something before you realize it’s something that needs to be fought. I definitely have problem. I have ADD and I’m stressed. I can’t focus, I can’t relax, and I feel like I have no control over my life and what I actually want out of it. So here I am. I’m on a self-inflicted seclusion in the middle of nowhere, smack-dab in the middle of the great ol’ US of A. The town is called Moorhead and it’s in Minnesota, bordering North Dakota and slightly bigger town called Fargo. You may have heard about it. They made a movie. I won’t bore you with the details of my expedition, or berate you with the fact that Fargo (the movie) was actually a misnomer because it was the Minnesota, that is, Moorhead, police that actually solved the crime (actually, in retrospect, I guess I will). I also won’t bore you with the all details of my drive, yes drive, out here which include two and a half days of my cat meowing (yes, she meowed the whole way). I still hear her in my head. Meow. Meoooow. Meoowwww. As if a chainsaw was cutting her in half, while she was being choked by fishing line, and I was just watching. Trust me, none of that happened.

Good musicians are generous always, they share their gifts easily and, when they feel they are understood, they respond in ways that one might never imagine. They are great characters: huge, unpredictable, difficult, inspiring. In all my stories, including ‘Sofía the beautiful,’ these musicians are present, as the central character or, as in this case, as the chorus.

If someone emails you to offer you a free lunch, an art workshop for your children, an afternoon at the theatre AND a free vacuum cleaner, I'd challenge any of you to turn them down. Dirt Devil did just that this summer. And I'm not made of stone.
Interesting times we live in... That’s all I can say!

Endings. Again, like The House of the Devil - which I'm constantly comparing to as it's such an awesome movie - The Innkeepers somewhat challenges its audience. Did it really happen? I know of people who read the ending of The House of the Devil as a possible “dream state/imaginary” space as to say that the movie never really happened… strange yes, and I do not really agree with it either, but at the same time, I definitely feel that The Innkeepers does pose similar questions. Did it really happen or was it in the state of fear and confusion that brought it all on? The last shot lingers on for an eternity before presenting the answer. And I also find that last scene to be part of the intelligent narrative that West uses in The Innkeepers. It's not to unlike the viral video that was seen earlier. He builds to a climax with the exact same tricks that the viral video does. And this is a motif that I find runs vibrantly though the movie. Is it real or all just a trick? During the last half hour, I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a scene where Claire wakes up and it all had been a dream. Now this doesn’t happen obviously, but in some strange way there’s a feeling that it could have happened in the last act.

Back to the 10/14/05 article Times article, which cites public relations efforts without any room for criticism of them:
A.: I wouldn’t say I write like he did, especially since he is one of the greatest writers of my generation, but my favorite author of recent years has been David Foster Wallace. I think I share with him a respect for rather than a loathing of popular culture, and it seeps into everything I write. Like Wallace, I prefer to stretch and to challenge readers rather than ever to underestimate them and “write down” to them. In YA, I’m especially fond of John Green, David Levithan, and Jay Asher. In practical terms and like so many others, Stephen King’s On Writing has been profoundly influential in my work. I never start a new project without reading it.
This is nothing new, though. It’s been a part of my Christmas decorations for the past several years, actually. Except that for some reason, it’s rarely been used. Well, at least by me… I had a roommate for many of those years, so I can’t speak to whether it was used by anyone else.

Today was the best TRC day ever! (by the way the trc is where we go to teach investigators) we played some simon say in ukrainian, it took us 30 min just to get out side which the door was only 30 min away. We had the TRC tonight and I taught in 100% ukrainian and I wasnt nervous at all... well I was for the first half then I calmed down and it went really well, we coud even feel the spirit :) I know the Lord helped me today. oh yeah I forgot my Companion Elder Flint traded a B.o.M for a tie haha it was so funny!

I had warped to jump, and went through the gate pretty quickly. On the other side, I wasted no time aligning and warping to jump to the next gate on my list. As warp was initiating at an agonizingly slow pace, the whole fleet started breaking cloak around me. They must have turned and burned for the gate and jumped through after me.
Then the other day we had to start filling them up with the stuff we wanted to store over the Summer. Our dorm allows you to store your stuff in the basement for free so long as you don't own more than four boxes worth of stuff. This was a problem, because I wanted to store basically everything and I own decidedly more than four thirty-five gallon tubs of stuff.

There is also a photograph of a man standing at a press table in the middle of an empty arena, his hand covering his face in expressionistic gesture. This man seems like discoursing minister, full of pomp and rhetoric, and what occurs here is quite interesting. Does Pfeiffer suggest that signifiers of video and spectacle inducing media cover up feelings in society that seem to be much like old fashion worship? Are basketball players and media figures our temporary gods, replaced each night by new symbols? There is pessimism at work here.
But this is something which is immediately a source of contradiction in the work, because Nietzsche appeals extensively to linguistic data, on the origins and relationships of words, in order to support his point. But if language is determined by the needs of the ruling class, then this method will provide him with only half the story: history from the perspective of the ruling class.

Hola from Peru! We are the May Peru trip leaders Jess and Holly. We have had an incredible first few days and are excited to have started placements. We have had the wonderful opportunity of being able to watch the participants experience new relationships, new opportunities, and immerse themselves in the Peruvian culture. This week we are working on the construction of a daycare in Pacifico de Villa, as well as assisting at Laura Alva Saldana; a school for children with exceptionalities, and teaching English to children at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey schools. I (Jess) have been working at Laura Alva Saldana with four participants, where I would assist them with communicating with the teachers and students. While I (Holly) have been working at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey, assisting participants as they teach children English at the primary and secondary level. We would like to turn it over to a few of our participants, as they will be sharing some of their experiences this week. We encourage you to follow along with us on our amazing journey.
Penny Alesi recalls Idema's screams into the speakerphone and calling the persons on the receiving end vile names who preformed unspeakable sexual acts. Ms. Alesi and her “family” of three American cats were then living with Idema from March 31, 2009 - September 17, 2009; and was his close companion every single day. What she experienced in those months of horror will never be forgotten: Idema was constantly breaking phones, glasses, ashtrays, anything within reach because he was not happy with the way things were going in the States. However, he would not even attempt to return to America because he was afraid that the FBI had a sealed indictment that would put him in jail the moment he stepped foot on U.S. soil. Thus he would do all his business via phone, computer and fax. The problem was that Idema had broken rule number one of a successful con artist by drinking to excess and using illegal drugs like cocaine. As if wasn't enough to blow his cool, the dust to dawn bizarre sex escapades at his Casa Arabi that by themselves would have driven anyone over the edge.
This is deeply on my heart after talking with someone who walked out on his wife and kids. “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word.”
Families seemed to make up a huge proportion of passengers, to my surprise, and kids were often specially catered off. The Plantation includes a special kids meal time that precedes the main dinner service.

If the drunk driver was not at a bar or other business that serves alcohol before the crash, there is still the possibility of filing a claim through auto insurance. And in many cases, the drunk driver will also be punished in a criminal court. Although being found guilty for criminal charges can increase the likelihood of a civil personal injury case succeeding, you may still need the help of a drunk driving accident injury lawyer to deal with adjusters and use all the evidence correctly.

Even if the flute gets the spotlight for most of the time, TAAB2 is still a progressive rock album at its core. The songs are very well glued together, complex and intricate. Overshadowed by the flute as they might be, the guitars still sound pretty bad ass and the drumming is top notch. Because Ian’s voice is not as good as it was in his youth, he turned to a more mellow, low tone pitched delivery and, frankly, that’s a good thing; it blends very well with the album, and it proves that Ian is the kind of artist that is very aware of his limits and writes his songs accordingly. He hasn’t turned soft, if that’s what you’re thinking, nor has his music suffered a decline in quality – it’s just a tad different from what he used to do and it suits him well.

But this is what I did, and my bathroom was cleaner then than it is now that I have lots of time: I used that playing time (and you really only need five minutes) to get the toilet scrubbed, wiped down, and dried off. Then, since I've used the sink for my water supply, I clean that, using a different sponge, and rinse and dry it off. (Use rag towels for drying.) Wipe off the mirror.
I had never heard of the designation CODA (Child of Deaf Adult) until after I moved away from home and saw the Hallmark movie “Love is Never Silent.” In the movie, there’s a confrontational scene between the deaf parents and the hearing daughter after she’s moved away from home. During that scene, I broke down and sobbed like I’d never cried in all my life. In fact, I couldn’t even talk about that movie for a couple of years without starting to cry. I wasn’t angry with my parents. Nor do I think I had an unlucky childhood. That movie began a process which helped me learn how important it is that I embrace who I am. I am in both worlds, both deaf and hearing. My personality is different in each world. When I sign to deaf people I’m no longer shy. If I see a deaf person signing, I want to go over and introduce myself. In the hearing world, I’m much more reserved. Since then, I’ve learned to recognize that I can live in both worlds at the same time.

At 180 pages long the book has enough space to cover quite a wide range of topics and it does so. Starting with a background to the team, moving on to the cars technology, to overviews of its design and operation. With its familiar graphical style and hardback format it certainly gives the feel of a proper workshop manual. However this is somewhat skin deep and the pages within, soon revert to a more typical book on F1, although some flashes of the Haynes style do remain.
The first camp project challenge was to knit a two color project in either a shawl, scarf, or cape. I decided to opt for the shawl, since it's way too warm outside to be thinking about a scarf or a cape. I chose "Pamuya" by Alexandra Wiedmayer. I'm using stash yarn; Dream In Color Smooshy with Cashmere in "Joy in the Morning" and Colinette Jitterbug in a variegated blue. Here's my progress as of yesterday:
What the parties wanted to know was whether the exception for ephemeral recordings under copyright law also covered recordings made by legally independent external television production companies where those recordings were commissioned from them by DR or by TV2 Danmark for initial broadcast on DR or TV2 Danmark. According to DR and TV2 Danmark, it was irrelevant to copyright holders whether recordings for purposes of transmission were made by the staff of thea broadcasting organisation itself with its own equipment, or by an employee of a third company from which the broadcasting organisation commissioned the production, with that third company’s equipment. They also argued that there was no condition in Paragraph 31 of the Danish Law on Copyright to require broadcasting organisations to make recordings ‘by means of their own facilities’. Thus, under Danish law, it didn' tmatter, for the application of the exception concerning recordings for the purpose of transmission, whether those recordings were made by employees of the broadcasting organisation or by employees of third parties. NCB however argued that European Union law imposed a condition relating to production ‘by means of their own facilities’, this condition being applicable under the Danish Law on Copyright. The Østre Landsret (Eastern Regional Court) decided at this point that it was better to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling than to become increasingly baffled by these arguments. Accordingly it asked::
You may ask, then, why I have chosen a ball perched atop a steep hill to represent the very foundation of contemporary society. I make no claims of any great knowledge in neurology, psychology, anthropology, or sociology, but there is one characteristic of our society that my own observations have repeatedly led me to: this hill, this very foundation, is unstable. At any point, a small amount of force applied in the right direction can start the ball rolling back down, back to stable ground, to the agrarian, community-based economics practiced for so much of human history. A small shift in day-to-day life, or the rediscovery of a older, simpler tradition that, in the hustle and bustle of modern life, we didn’t realize we had forgotten – these little events on a societal or, more likely, personal level, can start the ball rolling. Moreover, if strong enough, they can completely derail all of the artificiality, materialism, and vice which have been forced upon us (by whom?: that is a whole discussion in itself), in order to separate us from our roots and keep us in a state of near-subservience.
Actually I have two main characters – and they’re both boys. I don’t know how I did it but I literally got inside the head of two sixteen year old boys. It was an out of body experience.

When I peeled and cut up my peaches for freezing in the summer, I took all the peels, dumped them in a pot, covered with water and boiled for a while to extract all the peachy goodness. I got 8 cups of juice and stuck that in the freezer. When it thaw, the top of the containers were pretty clear, so I poured off the top and just used the dense peach juice on the bottom for my jelly.
Every era had its styles and often times they were copied from others. So, over time, old European cities become a clutter of styles and shapes. But nobody really wants to go back to very old tastes. I doubt anybody would prefer candles and oil lamps over electric lights. And we can't really function now without good office buildings. Private homes are another matter but I doubt anyone really wants to live in a mud brick hut rather than a modern house.

I am reminded of James Howard Kunstler's admonition that during times of great stress mass delusions of deliverance--in this case through technology--are often afoot. I cannot fault fusion researchers for working on the intriguing problem of sustaining a fusion reaction that will produce more energy than it consumes. Nor can I fault them for seeking out the safest fuel possible. But the drumbeat in the media that alternatives are just around the corner--if we will only do things such as set up a Moon base and mine the surface--take the public's eye off more viable responses.
I really like the world itself. The Wall, the Others and all the Houses and their strongholds are really imaginative and I can’t wait to read more about them.

Through his many shenanigans, Mancini has always been there to defend him – like a good manager is supposed to do. But following the defeat at Arsenal, it seemed Balotelli’s biggest fan had finally given up on him. Mancini stated: “City cannot afford to play Balotelli anymore. He will sit out for the rest of the season.” With that, it looks increasingly likely that the game against Arsenal was his final appearance in a sky blue shirt.
In contrast, to address these challenges the SNP Government have focused upon reinvigorating our economy by investing in infrastructure projects such as building new homes, roads, hospitals and investments such as the new Airdrie Health Centre.

Last weekend I was challenged to think about what I’m passionate about. I attended a writer’s workshop in Denver to learn more about the possibility of publishing a book on conscious creation. During that seminar, I experienced an extreme range of emotion. First I was elated, filled with inspiration and creativity and dreams of the New York Times bestseller list in my mind. The next day, reality set in when I learned how difficult publishing can be, how rare it is to succeed in the industry and how much time needs to be devoted to not just writing a book but promoting it as well.

I see that ethics have all but been vanquished in the workplace, leaving only the least empathetic personalities to fill positions of usury and greed, and causing a form of stress that can only be described as a forced and burdensome moral subversion for those who otherwise might be content in an ethical and moral occupation. But most of our current employment opportunities require the very subversion of the people they are hired to help - be it “customer service”, “sales”, a “government representative”, or an “agent” of one form or the other, from insurance to collections to police to court workers. And like Pavlov’s Dog we are set forth on our workweek with a reward system, earning incentives and bonuses for the number of other people we can hurt for a profit; judged by how many worthless financial products or insurance policies we can unload through high pressure sales techniques that are required learning by unscrupulous corporations.

Net result? Most computer programmers are guys. Not because they’re naturally more talented at it, and not even (entirely) because there are sexist barriers to entry to that field, but because when this generation of girls was ten years old, they were told by the media that tech is a boys’ world, and that the world to which they should aspire centers around housekeeping, looking pretty and breeding. Even if no one else in her life told her she couldn’t be a programmer, she’s unlikely to pursue that career because not enough people told her she could.

Danesbury Hill is lovely to walk along. We saw four different types of butterflies : chalk blue, marbled white, red admiral and an orange one I have yet to identify. There were lots of flowers, including self-heal, clover, yellow vetches, forget-me-nots and some yellow ones which I didn’t know what they were. There were also two ponies grazing the land. I think I saw a medlar tree, but since it’s the first I’ve seen I need to check it in my identification books. Medlars are unique in that the fruits of the tree are only edible when they are rotten.

I stumbled across a number of modern quilting blogs and was just floored by the bold use of colour and pattern, and the striking difference between these quilts (and quilters) and the more traditional ones I knew quite well from my graduate work in Folklore (material culture studies was one of my secondary fields). I had never considered quilting before,

Across the hallway is the fabric-covered cork board. We used a mirror that was a gift from my MIL and turned it into this corkboard. This was the first cork board I ever did and I didn’t research it very well thinking it looked pretty straightforward. But after putting it all together the tacks didn’t stay in, so in my ignorance I bought more cork board thinking it just needed another layer. They stay in a little bit better but not great. I definitely recommend cutting a piece of cardboard to put behind cork boards like we did in the office.

What really impresses me about fashion on the British high street is that it works really hard to be wantable. They rotate their stock every four to six weeks and can respond very quickly to new trends. Something like Mad Men: it’s on TV for a couple of months, it’s a very definitive fashion statement and the stores are always very reactive to that.

Yet, there were other early influences in my father’s life, ones that spoke of need and want. Born in 1918, he went through the Depression as a young man, and knew hunger and hardship first hand. While my mother regaled my sisters and I with stories of simple Christmases on her childhood farm in rural New York State, my father kept silent. Only later, when I was an adult, did he share the truth of having had little or nothing.

Consider your make-up when purchasing a red cocktail dress. Uncover a shade of lipstick and blush that enhances your gown rather than matching it just. Stop buyer's remorse by attempting around the cocktail dress using your heels and accessories while in the shop. Shell out near focus for your hair, eye shade and system kind; invest in a dress that not just flatters your figure but matches your skin tone superbly.

Courts in Community Patent Convention (CPC) jurisdictions will probably look to each other for precedent. While knowledge of the patent appears to be required in the US, it does not seem to be required in CPC countries. The requisite degree of knowledge required in the US appears to be the specific intent of the indirect infringer, whilst in Germany and the UK it is the supplier's knowledge of the intention of the buyer that matters. In the CPC countries, it suffices that the knowledge exists at the time of offer. Presumption of intent if means provided are particularly suited for use according to patent or supplier has highlighted such use in marketing or other informational materials in the CPC countries.

Agni-V, the ICBM test fired by India five days ago, is capable of carrying nuclear warheads and has been touted as being crucial for India’s defence against China. The missile can carry a pay-load of 1 tonne, is 17 m long, 2 m wide and weighs 50 tonnes. After the missile is inducted into India’s strategic forces by 2014-2015, India will acquire a strong deterrent capacity against China.

Unlike the Facebook and LinkedIn UIs, which provide lists of people you do know and a list of people you should know, Levo League’s welcome page presents you with something a bit more aspirational — a corner office. The UI is beautiful, and you can navigate to a career search, office hours, mentoring from successful women and other yet-to-be-launched features. Mentoring topics include workplace relationship advice, professional fashion guidance, how to ask for a raise and some of the “softer skills” around success that you typically have to learn as you go, or you consult your mom or sister.
As for the family, They will be a family of 5 (1 son and 2 daughters) who are not nobility, but come from prosperous families who have made their fortunes in the textile and timber trades, and also investments in shipping. I'm still working on the individual members of the family and staff. Mostly they are inspired by my favorite movie characters. I've given a lot more thought to the staff then the actual family. My biggest source of information was the book "Victorian House" by Judith Flanders.
On the afternoon of Monday, January 8, 1912, Mrs. Grace Johnson, the director of the Springfield Museum of Natural History and Miss Fannie Stebbins, the supervisor of natural science for the Springfield School Department, assembled a group of amateur bird watchers and organized the Springfield Bird Club. The purpose of the club was “to attract, conserve and study birds.” A century later, the Allen Bird Club, as it soon came to be known, is still carrying out this original purpose.
On a practical level, site your plot within easy reach of a water supply. If the summer is dry you’ll be glad of a nearby tap.

Second, both in the public rooms and in the private family quarters above, I couldn't help but be struck by what it must take to maintain it, in terms of both time and money. For each lovingly maintained detail, there was an equal amount of decay. My hostess, a gifted and animated storyteller, had wonderful tales to tell about keeping the ancient pipes in order, seeking authorizations for renovations, giving tours of the property to all manner of people including the prince and princess of Belgium. She had us all in tears with laughter. But she also sighed with sadness when she explained that her family will very likely have to sell the property soon because the costs for needed repairs and day to day upkeep simply outstrip the family's ability to pay. It's a poisoned heritage, she explained.

Everybody loves a roadmap. In fact, many sources of technology and even whole businesses are devoted to helping others create these maps. For example, Trainingpeaks.com – for coaches and athletes who have a fitness goal or objective to complete a specific race distance, Smartsheet – for online project management, Stratigent – for business analytics programs, myfitnesspal.com – for tracking and planning caloric intake for weight-loss, and many more. In the field of sport psychology, consultants might use a periodized mental skills training program (PMST) to help athletes stay on target for developing specific skills for optimal performance. One example is how a track and field athlete might apply strategic development of mental skills for throwing. How can I use this concept of a roadmap for my own career development?

We went ringing at Al Ali Farm in the afternoon last weekend. I had only been ringing at this site once before and it looks like a great site. There are plenty of tall trees, shrubs and open fields and a lot of birds where about. In the trees we set three nets hoping to catch Rufous-tailed Scrub Robin and Common Redstart which were seen in good numbers as we were setting up the nets. We also hoped we could catch a few Ortolan buntings in the grass field as Brendan and Nicole had caught 21 birds there the weekend before in one attempt. As it turned out most of the Ortolan Buntings had moved on and plenty of House Sparrows were in the fields along with a number of Daurian Shrikes and Turkestan Shrikes. Abdulla came for an hour and hoped to catch a Lesser Grey Shrike that he had seen but it evaded the trap and was not caught. …

While that may be the strangest post title I've ever used, it's true. Last week, Joann's was getting rid of their Halloween section at 60% off, and I happened across a rather fantastic mullet wig with matching mustache.

I didn't really think too much about what my costume plans were but, using the mullet as my entire inspiration, I woke up yesterday and raided my husband's closet for the most redneck things I could find and ended up with this.

A couple of weeks ago my writing took a bit of a blow; having had a spectacular start to the masters course with A+ grades and general good feelings about my work coming from most angles, I decided to take some risks with my subject matter and style. I thought I had stepped up my game, I felt my prose had taken on a poetic aspect and I was writing the strange, macabre tales I would love to read. But, without any prior notice, my grade dropped rather significantly. Perhaps the risks were a mistake, or perhaps the process of marking creative writing will always be a subjective practice no matter how greatly objectivity is pursued. Either way I didn’t take the criticism very well. I called my friends who met me immediately in the pub for five hours of Articulate (possibly the best board game ever) and copious amounts of cloudy cider. Hugging the toilet bowl the following morning, a promise I had made myself a few years ago not to turn to alcohol in times of rejection/massive self-pity resurfaced. A little too late maybe, but I reaffirmed it that day all the same.

In contrast, to address these challenges the SNP Government have focused upon reinvigorating our economy by investing in infrastructure projects such as building new homes, roads, hospitals and investments such as the new Airdrie Health Centre. Initiatives such as these protect existing jobs and create new ones by bringing money back into the local economy and therefore supporting economic growth.
Now to be fair, most of the press stories quoted above do make it clear that individual employers will still have a steep hill to climb in justifying forced retirement. You could pick fault here and there with the detail but there are lots of quotes from lawyers trying to explain the case in simple terms and emphasising that each case has to be judged on its own merits. Once you get past the headlines, I think the press have generally done a good job, all things considered.

Once a top appraiser at Christie's auction house, Elyse has spent her years on the show using objects ranging from canons to horse saddles as the jumping off point to make amazing discoveries about U.S. history. At one point, Elyse found a piece of Amelia Earhart's airplane. At another juncture, she helped find the S.S. Portland, a sunken ship in Alaska which was the first ship that found gold there!

This test will be of individual words and non-words. Pupils will be asked to show that they can offer the correct readings for the real words and plausible readings for the non-words ie pronouncing the letters and letter-combinations with the sounds that the children have been taught. So, for example a non-word with the 'ou' letters in the middle could be pronounced either as 'ou' in 'sound' or as 'ou' in 'wound' (as in 'hurt') (all southern English pronunciations). Whether they could pronounce it as the 'ou' in 'touch' is, I think, unlikely. We shall see whether 'rare' pronunciations will be allowed when the actual test comes out.

Imagine that, an individual, although we know it’s a particular faction, attacks a faith group knowing the reaction it may cause, knowing that in the ensuing conflict created by them somebody may get killed and they don’t care ,they really don’t care. AAWR operates somewhat differently to most nationalist sites, rather than adopting the new line, we and certainly this writer believes that traditional nationalism is the only way, that contestation of any and all groups who undermine, attack or exploit us is both desirable and indeed necessary. Indeed it is easy to look about us, to view the wider world and to see the hand of Zion creating mischief, it seems that all of the world’s great religions can be attacked, that centuries old faith systems can simply be ridiculed, their adherents belittled regardless of cost to peace and stability.

If violent video games were the cause for aggression in school, then there would be far more violence than we are seeing today. The truth is, despite all of the lobbying to get parental warnings on video games, the number one sellers for each year are always first person shooters. So why are we seeing an increase in emotional support schools and not an increase in violent behaviors associated with these graphic games? The answer shouldn’t surprise you. We have effectively misplaced our direction to focus on the outward sources rather than the inward struggle.

When I was 13, it actually happened. We went through family therapy in which I found out my dad had cheated on my mom, more than once. I was upset, but he was still my father. I still wanted him to come to my recitals and award ceremonies, but soon realized that this desire was seen by mother as a slight. She took to ask us who we loved more, and when my dad came to pick us up, he didn’t come in the house. From that point on, my sister took on a lot of the work of raising me–she was the one who talked to me about college, taught me how to drive and took me to get my license, lectured me when I stayed out past curfew, got me up for church on Sundays, hugged me when my mom came home from work and spent the rest of the night in bed.

Yes, you might be a prisoner of the Germans, but if that German officer is senior in rank to you, then you salute him. That is the British way.
For starters, no one is property, we are not owned by anyone. Second of all, women especially are not property. To me, that shows insecurity, and the fact that this kid said it the way he did, I think either he learned it from friends or his own dad. Plus, he crashed her car, she didn’t crash it, and yet he is telling her to ‘shut up’ which is the most uncalled for act he could have done besides referring to her as his ‘property.’ It wasn’t her fault, it was his, but the whole endeavor was just uncalled for

That said, when I go back and think about how the film was edited, I’d be hard-pressed to say what I would add back in while keeping the violence level toned down — not a lot of gore in the film as opposed to the book — and the film at a reasonable length.

Recently I was part of a debate, in which the discussion got really heated up. It got to a point where some individual that was involved in the debate took what I was saying very personally.

I respect where they are coming from and can understand them, however I am a very “by the book” kind of person, and I believe in keeping things simple.

For the record, at this point let's see if we can't dig out the actual meaning of the term Mary-Sue. Because it did have a useful definition once, before it was co-opted and turned into a two-word mud-pie to diminish female characters. And that definition was this:
I'm not a very "in the moment" person. My head is usually recreating the past into ever rolling reinvented versions of the future. On the "Meyers Brigg", if you are familiar with that personality type tool, I'm an extreme "N', iNtuitive, living in the world of possibilities and connections, and not at all Sensing, grounded in reality and concrete things. The only time I get peace from my mind is when I run. There is something about the simple awareness of lungs, heart and muscle connecting with air and ground. Noticing the adrenaline kicking in and lifting my old joints into fluidity. Feeling the sun prickle my skin as the sweat rises. (In California. In Scotland it was the biting, icy wind). It was training for this event last year that reignited my dormant running addiction, and I feel quite satisfied that I'm going into it this year feeling strong and trained.

It’s also time for me to put on my big girl socks and get my professional face on. Not to say I haven’t been professional! I’ve just spent a lot of time getting to know my delightful cast and taking things as they come. Now it’s time to remember I need to pull back and get my head completely in the game. Things are only going to get more intense from here on out so it’s so critical for me to be as focused and ready. And trust me, I am ready. I’m hungry for this.

Atop the endplate is the revised vane and cascade arrangement. The vane is now more rectangular in appearance and serves both to direct airflow and meet the minimum side-elevation bodywork surface area for the endplate. To this are fitted two cascade elements, a larger two element winglet and the smaller single element winglet. These downforce producing sections also are angles to aid the general outswept airflow in this area.
I am well into triple figures now, and thought instead of continuing to purchase, I would take another look at the books I have.

Driven shows all the hallmarks of Sallis’ succint prose and spot on pacing. However, the ambiguous plot points wore thin after awhile. Instead of opening up the text, the atmospheric, cerebral writing closed it off. But maybe I just wasn’t in the right mood for this book at the time I read it. Maybe I was searching for easy reading, a paint by numbers. (I read this after running a half-marathon. It’s hard to enjoy a book when phantom wildebeests are shredding your calf muscles with horn and head.)

I see that ethics have all but been vanquished in the workplace, leaving only the least empathetic personalities to fill positions of usury and greed, and causing a form of stress that can only be described as a forced and burdensome moral subversion for those who otherwise might be content in an ethical and moral occupation. But most of our current employment opportunities require the very subversion of the people they are hired to help - be it “customer service”, “sales”, a “government representative”, or an “agent” of one form or the other, from insurance to collections to police to court workers. And like Pavlov’s Dog we are set forth on our workweek with a reward system, earning incentives and bonuses for the number of other people we can hurt for a profit; judged by how many worthless financial products or insurance policies we can unload through high pressure sales techniques that are required learning by unscrupulous corporations.

Somewhere in the middle there I gave up on this book, and didn’t write a word for almost a year. I thought I was done. It was just too hard, and I wasn’t cut out to be a writer. In fact, that was part of the logic in going to South America. I thought if walking down those streets again couldn’t rekindle the fire I first felt, nothing would. It was a gamble, but when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.

Yet, there were other early influences in my father’s life, ones that spoke of need and want. Born in 1918, he went through the Depression as a young man, and knew hunger and hardship first hand. While my mother regaled my sisters and I with stories of simple Christmases on her childhood farm in rural New York State, my father kept silent. Only later, when I was an adult, did he share the truth of having had little or nothing.

You can tell almost immediately that Harber (who also penned the Eddie Romero-directed flick The Kidnappers and an episode of "Hawaii 5-0") had a copy of "Island Of Lost Souls" sitting by his typewriter as he knocked out this script. After all, when you have an island, an evil and/or mad scientist, experiments shrouded in secrecy and an unseen monster, there's every indication that you're not watching an original work. Yes, this is a story that has been done time and again, and would be done even more times than here (shall we flash-forward to 1977 and 1996, anyone? No? Wise choice.) and this isn't even the worst example of this retelling. At least they do us the honor of not giving us a title like H.G. Wells' Terror Is A Man or a subtitle like Terror Is A Man: Island Of Lost Souls. Points for integrity, guys.

The initial driver for fortnightly collections of residual waste, such as that placed in green bins in Amber Valley, was an apparent shortage of landfill sites to bury waste. However, a reduction in costs for the collecting authority is also a major factor in the decision to reduce collection frequency. It is also obvious that reducing residual waste capacity forces many households to recycle more of their waste.
Having been raised listening to these songs, it was nice to see these songs be performed by these homegrown artists. It was a homecoming of sorts.

Entire communities devastated?

But when was the last time you read of such social devastation resulting from a hate crime in America?

In a preview of an upcoming episode from ABC’s program, What Would You Do?, an irritated diner patron comes to the aid of a waitress being verbally harassed by another customer. The waitress ins questions, is a real transgender woman but the verbally-abusive customer is an actor. The program puts forth an interesting scenario, and one that I’m sure plays out more and more often, and it’s great to see someone standing up for the woman, who is, indeed, just trying to do her job. Interestingly, when the actor asks the irritated patron if he thinks it’s “ok for someone to be disgusting,” the patron replies, “It’s okay to be whoever you want to be. This is America.”

As you can see, the dog and the kitten have a very close relationship...actually the dog is obsessed with the kitten.

I must admit that at first glance the thought of enjoying a day on the beach just down from Port-au-Prince does seem tacky at best. But as I continued to explore the idea, it occurred to me that the discussion is really one of scale. Haiti has been and will continue to be one of the poorest countries in the world. People died of malnutrition and disease there long before the current disaster, and yet the cruise ships came. In ten years, people will still be dying of causes that the tourists could never comprehend, and yet the cruise ships will come. If I, as an individual, didn't care about or contribute to the solution before, cancelling my cruise now won't actually affect the outcome.

Before the 1830s, trains had not yet spread widely across the English country side and many factories still relied on canals for the transport of raw materials and goods to market. The postal system and its need to carry mail and people along particular routes required reform and refurbishment of the infrastructure during the late Regency period. Thomas Telford and John McAdam (of the Tar-McAdam or tarmac fame despite his not using tar in his construction, but possibly because of family business in the 18th century involving tar and shipbuilding) led to widespread renovations and improvements (in terms of the roads taking people where they wanted to go) on the Roman roads, including the Great North Road, the corridor between London and Edinburgh that is now called the A1.
But this is something which is immediately a source of contradiction in the work, because Nietzsche appeals extensively to linguistic data, on the origins and relationships of words, in order to support his point. But if language is determined by the needs of the ruling class, then this method will provide him with only half the story: history from the perspective of the ruling class.

“Speak!” announces a title card in the opening sequence of Michel Hazanavicius’ award-winning film, The Artist. A dashing middle-aged man is being tortured on-screen as he is repeatedly shocked with high voltage currency in an attempt to break his silence. Without any preparation, we cut to a smartly dressed audience in a cinema auditorium, visibly enthralled by something they are seeing. A reverse angle reveals that they are watching the torture scene we ourselves have just seen. Now we are both watching the same movie, and both equally thrilled – though ours is doubled through our awareness.

2) Produce Truck! A few days ago, I saw a produce truck in my neighborhood. I’ve never seen before, although they’re catching on in cities across the country. I read an article about one in Detroit a few years back, and thought it was a great idea. Basically, vendors sell produce out of the back of a truck (like ice cream), driving around neighborhoods where residents don’t have easy access to fresh, healthy food, usually due of a lack of grocery stores. My neighborhood isn’t lacking in supermarkets (there are three within walking distance of my place, and two of them have low produce prices), but it’s a concept that I think is wonderful, so when I saw the truck a few days ago, I decided to stop and buy something from it the next time I saw it.

Once a top appraiser at Christie's auction house, Elyse has spent her years on the show using objects ranging from canons to horse saddles as the jumping off point to make amazing discoveries about U.S. history. At one point, Elyse found a piece of Amelia Earhart's airplane. At another juncture, she helped find the S.S. Portland, a sunken ship in Alaska which was the first ship that found gold there!
I was reading a thriller the other day, one of those convoluted stories with a dozen endings as if the author couldn’t figure out which ending he wanted to use. There were three crimes, all dealing with the same group of people yet none of the crimes were related. One of the crimes was a kidnapping, and though I know who did the kidnapping, the story was so complicated I still don’t know who instigated it. Despite all the flaws of the book, the one thing that took me out of the story was a typo. The author tried to set the scene using smells — the aroma of an expensive cigar, the smell of leather chairs, the scent of Channel Number 5 lingering in the air.

In order to infuse a bit of Irish culture into our wedding, after the rehearsal dinner we decided to have a traditional seisiún (session) with a live Irish band and lots of Guinness and Irish Coffee. It was wild and we had all the guests doing ‘Riverdance’ type moves all night! The day of the wedding we rented a red double decker bus to take the wedding party and our families to and from the ceremony, it was a hit! Definitely went along with our vintage Ireland theme. We also included some traditional Irish dishes like Leek & Potato soup and Irish Smoked Salmon on the dinner menu.

When Lord Archer, for example, was at the height of his fame and political prominence, the media was afraid to write about him in a less than positive fashion. He was known to be litigious, and had won a huge award from the Daily Star for libel in 1987. Lord Archer was a prominent and powerful man whose reputation, despite being chipped away at round the edges by Michael Crick and by Private Eye, was still very high.

On the paths through the gardens we sheet mulched, which means we covered the ground with cardboard and then covered that with wood chips to prevent weeds and grass from growing. This is a great way to keep weeds out of your garden. If you garden, you know weeds can quickly spread from a weedy to a non-weedy area, so if we completely weed out an entire yard or garden, it will be way more difficult for the weeds to get into your garden beds. It also just looks better to have clearly visible, neat and weedless paths going through your beds. It was a lot of work weeding out all that grass and shoveling all those wood chips…but it will be so worth it down the road when we don’t have to weed so often! Plus it’s a great workout. We joke at the garden that if you garden you don’t need to buy a gym membership. And it’s a great way to work on your tan.

If the drunk driver was not at a bar or other business that serves alcohol before the crash, there is still the possibility of filing a claim through auto insurance. And in many cases, the drunk driver will also be punished in a criminal court. Although being found guilty for criminal charges can increase the likelihood of a civil personal injury case succeeding, you may still need the help of a drunk driving accident injury lawyer to deal with adjusters and use all the evidence correctly.

There is also a photograph of a man standing at a press table in the middle of an empty arena, his hand covering his face in expressionistic gesture.

Does Pfeiffer suggest that signifiers of video and spectacle inducing media cover up feelings in society that seem to be much like old fashion worship? Are basketball players and media figures our temporary gods, replaced each night by new symbols? There is pessimism at work here.
Endings. Again, like The House of the Devil - which I'm constantly comparing to as it's such an awesome movie - The Innkeepers somewhat challenges its audience. Did it really happen? I know of people who read the ending of The House of the Devil as a possible “dream state/imaginary” space as to say that the movie never really happened… strange yes, and I do not really agree with it either, but at the same time, I definitely feel that The Innkeepers does pose similar questions. Did it really happen or was it in the state of fear and confusion that brought it all on? The last shot lingers on for an eternity before presenting the answer. And I also find that last scene to be part of the intelligent narrative that West uses in The Innkeepers. It's not to unlike the viral video that was seen earlier. He builds to a climax with the exact same tricks that the viral video does. And this is a motif that I find runs vibrantly though the movie. Is it real or all just a trick? During the last half hour, I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a scene where Claire wakes up and it all had been a dream. Now this doesn’t happen obviously, but in some strange way there’s a feeling that it could have happened in the last act.
The fact that the 10-year period certain option costs very little extra is a factor, too, he says.

Then the other day we had to start filling them up with the stuff we wanted to store over the Summer. Our dorm allows you to store your stuff in the basement for free so long as you don't own more than four boxes worth of stuff. This was a problem, because I wanted to store basically everything and I own decidedly more than four thirty-five gallon tubs of stuff.
“Our pools are more crammed to the gills than the unit 4 pool at Fukushima Daiichi, much more so,” noted Kamps of Beyond Nuclear. “It’s kind of like a very thick forest that’s waiting for a wildfire. It would take extraordinary measures to prevent nuclear chain reactions in our pools because the waste is so closely packed in there.”
This isn't to punish us. Everything in life is showing us our connection to every other thing - the wheels are set in motion for all of us.

Planning to hit the studio in early June to lay down tracks for their third album, WOE’s reworked “Quietly, Undramatically” opens a new door on the title track from the band’s popular 2010 release of the same name. Vocalist/guitarist Chris Grigg notes, “the remixed version of ‘Quietly, Undramatically’ is a more accurate representation of what was hoped to achieve with the material and offers a different perspective into the album.” Decibel Magazine said, “Woe strive for sophistication without falling into the usual pitfalls of pretentiousness, cartoonish-ness or undue gloss. Essential aggression is maintained, while the atmospheric and emotional depth envelopes are pushed with a bold fearlessness.”

Yet, there were other early influences in my father’s life, ones that spoke of need and want. Born in 1918, he went through the Depression as a young man, and knew hunger and hardship first hand. While my mother regaled my sisters and I with stories of simple Christmases on her childhood farm in rural New York State, my father kept silent. Only later, when I was an adult, did he share the truth of having had little or nothing.

"It could only happen on Top Of The Pops - it's classical guitar" If you like, Jimmy. "Where could you get such class except Top Of The Pops?" rhetorically asks a man who chose to dress like that. Both parties sit, the crowd stand pensively around the perimeter of a small circular stage I don't think we've ever seen before. It's pretty much what you'd expect Feelings performed by Cleo Laine with John Williams to sound like, a reminder that throughout this decade you'd get stuff well out of the pop loop - the Shadows were regulars well into the 80s - in an attempt to paint the show as inclusive and classy. The response is appropriately Two Ronnies audience-like.
Now to be fair, most of the press stories quoted above do make it clear that individual employers will still have a steep hill to climb in justifying forced retirement. You could pick fault here and there with the detail but there are lots of quotes from lawyers trying to explain the case in simple terms and emphasising that each case has to be judged on its own merits. Once you get past the headlines, I think the press have generally done a good job, all things considered.

Also at Westminster we find a list headed ‘Stuffe brought frome the late Erle of Essex House at the Austen Freers Attaynted’ – this Earl of Essex being Thomas Cromwell, who was executed six and a half years before Henry’s own death. The list of ‘stuffe’ kept includes beds & bedlinen. There is also, at Greenwich, a bedstead decorated with the cipher of Queen Jane, on which the valances and counterpane are decorated with the cipher of Queen Anne. Which Queen Anne (Boleyn, or of Cleves) isn't specified - but could anyone really have had restful slumber in such a spot?!

Since my Washington, D.C. address and the writing of this article, I conducted two vitally important pieces of research work on Dr. Bob and his younger years in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. First, my son and I visited St. Johnsbury, Vermont twice over a total period of three weeks. We were able to find literally thousands of relevant records, manuscripts, books, sermons, teachings, newspapers articles, and other writings that showed the immense Christian upbringing Dr. Bob had as a youngster in Vermont. His upbringing involved the Great Awakening of 1875 which preceded his birth but impacted on the entire community of St. Johnsbury. It involved his Congregationalist parents and their indoctrination of Bob with facts about salvation and the Word of God. It involved the North Congregational Church of St. Johnsbury, Vermont where the entire Smith family attended church services at least 4 times each week. The father was a Deacon, a member of the Executive Committee, and a Sunday school teacher. The mother helped write a history of the church, headed its Christian education program, sang in the choir, and was active in many church activities. The Young Men’s Christian Association, as well as the Young People’s Society of Christian Endeavor, played a major role in the church; and the YMCA, of which Bob’s father was President, was also active in St. Johnsbury Academy which Dr. Bob attended.

Penny Alesi recalls Idema's screams into the speakerphone and calling the persons on the receiving end vile names who preformed unspeakable sexual acts. Ms. Alesi and her “family” of three American cats were then living with Idema from March 31, 2009 - September 17, 2009; and was his close companion every single day. What she experienced in those months of horror will never be forgotten: Idema was constantly breaking phones, glasses, ashtrays, anything within reach because he was not happy with the way things were going in the States. However, he would not even attempt to return to America because he was afraid that the FBI had a sealed indictment that would put him in jail the moment he stepped foot on U.S. soil. Thus he would do all his business via phone, computer and fax. The problem was that Idema had broken rule number one of a successful con artist by drinking to excess and using illegal drugs like cocaine. As if wasn't enough to blow his cool, the dust to dawn bizarre sex escapades at his Casa Arabi that by themselves would have driven anyone over the edge.

Also, I forgot to pull on the reins and actually stop the horse. Like I said. Imbecile.

I have a bit of a rocky relationship with cheesecake. We’ve never really seen eye to eye. I want a beautiful, creamy, delicious dessert. Cheesecake wants to crack like the Grand Canyon, no matter how many tips I try to keep it from happening. Water bath? Yep. Room temperature ingredients? Check. Turn the heat up then down? Done it. I’ve left the oven door closed while cooling. I’ve left it cracked. Short of a cheesecake rain dance, I’ve tried it all—to no avail. So I reeeeally didn’t want to make it, because I knew I’d just end up disappointed again.
On the afternoon of Monday, January 8, 1912, Mrs. Grace Johnson, the director of the Springfield Museum of Natural History and Miss Fannie Stebbins, the supervisor of natural science for the Springfield School Department, assembled a group of amateur bird watchers and organized the Springfield Bird Club. The purpose of the club was “to attract, conserve and study birds.” A century later, the Allen Bird Club, as it soon came to be known, is still carrying out this original purpose.

A couple of evenings ago I watched a documentary on TV about Tony Onley. I was inspired by something that Jack Shadbolt said. It was not his words per se but the cultural attitude that he and Onley had about ‘art’ last century – specifically painting. I mused that it would be so fun if there was a daily TV show on interviewing eclectic people about art. Some interviewees could be ‘experts’ – professors of art history, painting, art criticism; some gallery owners, curators, jurists; practitioners of contemporary art; or art collectors of all stripes. Others could include exhibition opening visitors and supporters, those who have never been to a gallery or artists discussing various topics including directions in their current work. Let’s get back the passion people. Onley, Shadbolt, Wyman and others discussed painting with enthusiasm.
I see in Forrest Gump the most important qualities for a man to success: faith and persistence. He firmly believes in what he is doing and does everything with his full capacity. When he was young, he was only good at was running. He also enjoyed it. So he ran at his best and got into the football team, which later led him into college. In the Vietnam war, he followed the Lieutenant faithfully and treated him sincerely, which earned him a valuable lifelong friendship. Moreover, he was able to retreat when he could not fight through. He memorized Jenny’s words well: “Never try to be brave”. When one’s in overwhelming danger, the most optimal strategy is indeed saving up one’s energy for a better future.

Well Quinn was really celebrating last night. We went to Dave and Buster's and then home to watch movies. She decided this was the time to torment Belvedere, our beagle. I have never seen her so motivated and strong, trying to get to him and be by him despite Belvedere's lack of reciprocal interest in this interaction. It took both Riley and myself to play defense against her with Belvedere on my lap. Riley got his glasses ripped of and the brunt of Quinn's force. How in the world has Quinny gotten so strong? Gee - it is like she is a superhero or something. One with more flexibility than any other (she can do splits over the enemy). One that is obsessed with beagle dogs and being by them. Don't let her fool you with her cuteness. She is one tough cookie. Happy New Year everyone!

The Hunger Games reminds me of academic work. Sure, we don’t kill one another for entertainment. And, academic life isn’t about life or death, but the stakes are high and at times people are quite petty. The Tributes, though, are the pre-tenure faculty who have to participate in the department’s arena. Some Tributes face an easier match than others, but ultimately the senior faculty and others watch and wait to see who wins. The odds are ever in your favor to: teach, write, and pay service to the department and university. But, most departments really expect you to write, keep your head down, and know your place.

The image was colored with Cherry Cobbler, Garden Green and Hansome Hunter inkpads using a Dove blender pen. A bit of Mustard color ink was used to outline the image and make it pop. The panel was distressed using Tea Dye and Old Paper distress ink from Tim Holtz. A bit of yellow stickles to highlight the flower centers and a few silver rhinestone embellishments and that's it.

That's pretty well stood the test of time. I've heard that record a few too many times, for sure, but side one of that you can't even touch. It's just really spectacular. And they did that when they were 20? They were really young when they did that.

The fact that the 10-year period certain option costs very little extra is a factor, too, he says. For example, a $100,000 SPIA purchased by a 65-year-old man above would pay roughly $574 a month if he buys a $100,000 life-only SPIA, but only $23 less ($553 a month) if the SPIA is a life with 10-year period certain products.

Even if the flute gets the spotlight for most of the time, TAAB2 is still a progressive rock album at its core. The songs are very well glued together, complex and intricate. Overshadowed by the flute as they might be, the guitars still sound pretty bad ass and the drumming is top notch. Because Ian’s voice is not as good as it was in his youth, he turned to a more mellow, low tone pitched delivery and, frankly, that’s a good thing; it blends very well with the album, and it proves that Ian is the kind of artist that is very aware of his limits and writes his songs accordingly. He hasn’t turned soft, if that’s what you’re thinking, nor has his music suffered a decline in quality – it’s just a tad different from what he used to do and it suits him well.
“OK,” he says obligingly. So obligingly, in fact, that I know that wherever he’s been, he’s been doing something enjoyable that he feels slightly guilty about. I will have to interrogate him after he’s mended the iron.

Because I don’t normally run on a treadmill in front of a mirror, I hadn’t realized how lean and muscular my quads got in the last 6 months. I had no choice but to notice it today as the rower was positioned in front of a full mirror. Simply walking to the rower to clean off my well-hydrated puddles of sweat, I had no choice but to notice my quads flex with each step. I even have the V above the knee. I’ve never noticed this before.

I had already told her that I received stuff that wasn’t mine and how embarrassing it was and when she saw the label she of course started ribbing me about if it really wasn’t mine. I was utterly motified, but managed to play it off well. I was super embarrassed because if she saw it and had that reaction, how was I going to deal with it when I took it to UPS?? Thinking about it has me cringing even though I’m just returning things that were shipped to me on accident. Nothing to be embarrassed about, Girl!

You can tell almost immediately that Harber (who also penned the Eddie Romero-directed flick The Kidnappers and an episode of "Hawaii 5-0") had a copy of "Island Of Lost Souls" sitting by his typewriter as he knocked out this script. After all, when you have an island, an evil and/or mad scientist, experiments shrouded in secrecy and an unseen monster, there's every indication that you're not watching an original work. Yes, this is a story that has been done time and again, and would be done even more times than here (shall we flash-forward to 1977 and 1996, anyone? No? Wise choice.) and this isn't even the worst example of this retelling. At least they do us the honor of not giving us a title like H.G. Wells' Terror Is A Man or a subtitle like Terror Is A Man: Island Of Lost Souls. Points for integrity, guys.

For many intelligent Polish people, there are only so many times you can hear that when asked what the best thing in Poland is, people reply "Polish women". Don't get me wrong, I am married to a beautiful Polish women and would happily describe Polish women to any foreigner as being the most beautiful women in the world. However, there are a few more things to Poland that it's women :)
Discipline in schools is important to ensure a positive learning environment for all. I think clear, applicable, and relevant policies outlining behaviors and consequences is one way to ensure students and teachers feel safe to learn. These policies should be school (and perhaps even district) wide, applied consistently, and be fair to all students. Every student has the right to learn in a safe and secure environment and teachers deserve to teach in safe and secure schools.
On the paths through the gardens we sheet mulched, which means we covered the ground with cardboard and then covered that with wood chips to prevent weeds and grass from growing. This is a great way to keep weeds out of your garden. If you garden, you know weeds can quickly spread from a weedy to a non-weedy area, so if we completely weed out an entire yard or garden, it will be way more difficult for the weeds to get into your garden beds. It also just looks better to have clearly visible, neat and weedless paths going through your beds. It was a lot of work weeding out all that grass and shoveling all those wood chips…but it will be so worth it down the road when we don’t have to weed so often! Plus it’s a great workout. We joke at the garden that if you garden you don’t need to buy a gym membership. And it’s a great way to work on your tan.

Elsewhere terracotta tiles – tova – are being laid. The dining room looks superb and we have all but chosen the tables and chairs.

The second reservation is the pump.

Dad said nothing. He put the tree to the side of the house and went off again to find another one. This went ahead every year. Dad would find a tree and bring it back for Mom’s approval. It usually took three or four attempts before Mom decided she liked the first one best. Dad would then strip some boughs from the others before putting them on the wood pile. He bored holes in the trunk of the Christmas tree and inserted the extra boughs to fill it out.

The immortal Buster Keaton once said that tragedy is a close-up; comedy, a long shot. Horace Walpole put it in another perspective when he wrote that, “Life is a comedy for those who think…and a tragedy for those who feel.” Both of these great men were correct. Perspective is everything in life. If someone slips on a banana-peel and pratfalls, it might be funny to those nearby. But I guarantee you that the person who fell will have a very different opinion on the matter. Humor and tragedy are polarizing issues in that they represent opposite sides of the same coin. Most films try to pick one interpretation of their events and run with it, resulting in traditional comedies and dramas. But there are the rare occasions when filmmakers embrace both perspectives, reveling in both the intrinsic drama and absurdity of their plots. These are the black comedies.

Driven shows all the hallmarks of Sallis’ succint prose and spot on pacing. However, the ambiguous plot points wore thin after awhile. Instead of opening up the text, the atmospheric, cerebral writing closed it off. But maybe I just wasn’t in the right mood for this book at the time I read it. Maybe I was searching for easy reading, a paint by numbers. (I read this after running a half-marathon.

Net result? Most computer programmers are guys. Not because they’re naturally more talented at it, and not even (entirely) because there are sexist barriers to entry to that field, but because when this generation of girls was ten years old, they were told by the media that tech is a boys’ world, and that the world to which they should aspire centers around housekeeping, looking pretty and breeding. Even if no one else in her life told her she couldn’t be a programmer, she’s unlikely to pursue that career because not enough people told her she could.

Democrats delivered for unions by exempting the first $27,500 of a straight family’s health plan from the “Cadillac tax” and delayed any taxation on those benefits until 2018. Gay individuals, parents and their children who receive their health insurance through their domestic partners pay income tax on dollar one of their benefits. This is a huge disparity in the treatment of gays and straights. It is also a hardship for middle and low-income gay families and an injustice for all gays. Lobbying to include domestic partners in the “Cadillac tax” exemption would have been smart, non-controversial and helped many in our community. Instead of making progress, by ignoring this opportunity we were left with the expansion of a discriminatory system.

A funny thing has been happening lately. Opinion editors in Deshi English media, print and electronic, have been approaching me for political pieces. I suggest an economic or policy piece, they respond ‘yeah, that’s good, but how about (whatever is the headline that week)’. Beats me why this is — it’s not like I have a good track record of predicting Deshi politics. In fact, I am not at all qualified or knowledgeable to commentate on day-to-day politics of Bangladesh. Further, I don’t live in Bangladesh, and have a very dim view of pundits who claim to know Bangladesh better living in London than people back home.
We did have several other children who did respond and received Christ. We praise God for those decisions! We gave away 4 new Bibles to those who brought the most visitors.

Be sure to ask your student what their experience was in giving away stuff!
The simplicity of the measure is that if that a plot and you know its size then you can multiply one by the other and produce the allowable gross floor area of the scheme. For example if you have a site with a FAR of two you could build on half the site to four storeys, on one quarter of it to eight stories; in the absence of any other controls.
Wow! That is a pretty big challenge. There is a reason it is called “the shadow”. It can be a bit scary to take an honest look at what we are feeling and why. Isn’t it easier to sit in judgment and blame someone else than to take 100% responsibility for our own thoughts and actions? Ya, I think so too! But I have realized in recent days, months, years that I need to take 100% accountability for everything that happened or continues to happen in my life. Whether it’s the abuse I endured as a child, the issues in my marriage, or what I perceive to be happening within the roller derby league I was practicing with. This book reiterates what I already believe and that is that “thoughts are things” and we create our own world based on our thoughts. When I think, “Well they don’t like me and are ignoring me and leaving me out because they don’t like me” then it sets that “wish” into motion and sure enough I get more of what I perceived to be true. This just shows me that I am feeling separate from others….separate from my self…separate from God/Love. Where there is separation, there is fear. Where there is fear, there is the shadow. Where there is shadow, there is dis-ease, pain, sadness.
Every era had its styles and often times they were copied from others. So, over time, old European cities become a clutter of styles and shapes. But nobody really wants to go back to very old tastes. I doubt anybody would prefer candles and oil lamps over electric lights. And we can't really function now without good office buildings. Private homes are another matter but I doubt anyone really wants to live in a mud brick hut rather than a modern house.

Everyday, I read quotations by many different people who in some way or another have inspired me or who's work has resonated within me.

On the afternoon of Monday, January 8, 1912, Mrs. Grace Johnson, the director of the Springfield Museum of Natural History and Miss Fannie Stebbins, the supervisor of natural science for the Springfield School Department, assembled a group of amateur bird watchers and organized the Springfield Bird Club. The purpose of the club was “to attract, conserve and study birds.” A century later, the Allen Bird Club, as it soon came to be known, is still carrying out this original purpose.

Are there other reasons why a listing may be exempt? Absolutely. Maybe an executive is making a job transfer or there is a pending divorce and the home owners just don’t want to draw attention to their situation by having a “For Sale” sign in their front yard. In other words, they want to sell their home but prefer to keep a low profile. It is much harder to sell a home that we can’t advertise but for those of us that are connected in the community, surrounding areas & have a large network – it is doable. Once again, all it takes is that “right” buyer and if as a home owner, you are not listed, that “right” buyer will find something else.
But then, we hit the kicker--tort liability and the potential undermining of the First Amendment. We've already seen several high profile libel cases in recent years. Remember Carol Burnett v The National Enquirer, Inc? This was a landmark case, especially for celebrities, who had been spectacularly unsuccessful in libel cases prior to this. What made the case so important was the court's determination that the Enquirer had employed "actual malice" and that, because they didn't comply with the California regulations for newspapers, and as thus were liable for punitive damages despite the retraction they'd printed. After some pretty strenuous searching on my part, I haven't found any undermining of the First Amendment due to this tort liability. (I have, however, noticed that the National Enquirer has been tippy-toeing in its claims about celebrities since.)

Let us celebrate the biological ties of motherhood, but let us also celebrate the power of love and nurturing from all the women in our lives, even those women with whom we share no blood ties: grandmothers and aunties; "play" mothers and godmothers; church mothers and neighborhood mothers. Celebrate all the women who were not allowed to be mothers to their children. Celebrate all the women who cannot or will not ever be mothers. Celebrate the women who made the courageous decision to give their children to families who could care for them. Celebrate the women who, when left and abandoned, made a way out of no way for their children. Celebrate all the complications of motherhood...even loss. And while you celebrate, say a prayer for those who so deeply feel the pain of being a motherless child, including those of us who are motherless mothers.

The dialogue delivery was a pain all through the movie. Dev Patel was an eye sore and the Bollywood style romance with Frieda Pinto seemed utterly out of place.

It all seemed fictitious and unbelievable to me.
As is common, Paul’s tone for the entire letter seems to be overflowing as he recounts the budding virtues of faith, love and hope (vv. 2-3). Not only that, but the whole of the Macedonian and Achaian region witnessed the power of God in their lives. Paul states matter of factly that the veracity of his gospel is proven, not in the spoken word only, but in power and in the Holy Spirit. It is probable that due to the troubling outcome of his clash with the Athenian philosophers (Acts 17:16-34) he was seeking to remind them of the manner in which they received the gospel knowing that it is this distinctive that will sustain them through troubled times (1 Cor. 1:18-2:16).

Add 1 tbsp oil, fennel and onion to same skillet. Sauté until golden brown in spots and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Return chicken to pot, add broth and lemon juice. Bring to simmer, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until chicken is cooked through and sauce begins to thicken, about 20 minutes. Stir in cilantro just before serving, and add salt and pepper to taste.

Hamilton is equally blunt, saying that "If Gina Rinehart succeeds in getting a controlling interest in Fairfax Media ... the nation's political landscape will be changed." He goes on to list a slew of Rinehart's eminently regrettable policy foibles that reflect views evidently of long duration, since she "dropped out of the University of Sydney claiming the lecturers were communists". Hamilton gives us the names of those she trusts, and they echo ones included by Ferguson: Andrew Bolt and Alan Jones and Ray Hadley and Christopher Monckton and Ian Plimer and Hugh Morgan.
Go over each name and if you’re not sure who someone is ask who he or she is and why it’s important for him or her to be there. Don’t have an edge in your voice, just speak quite frankly.
Vanilla gets such a bad wrap, I really dislike that quote about people being described as 'very vanilla'. Bah, they are obviously talking about E numbers replacement for vanilla, as the real deal is such a sophisticated yet straightforward flavour.

Tomorrow is my 30th birthday. Friday is Caleb's due date. I'll never be able to forget his due date because it's so close to my birthday. I had it in my head that maybe I'd go into labor a few days early and we'd share a birthday. Or even better, he'd be born a few days early and I'd still be able to say I was 29 when I had him. I should be worrying about my mucus plug falling out or my water breaking in the middle of Target, not worrying about whether surgery is the right decision and whether I'll ever be lucky enough to be pregnant again. Can this week just please be over?
If violent video games were the cause for aggression in school, then there would be far more violence than we are seeing today. The truth is, despite all of the lobbying to get parental warnings on video games, the number one sellers for each year are always first person shooters. So why are we seeing an increase in emotional support schools and not an increase in violent behaviors associated with these graphic games? The answer shouldn’t surprise you. We have effectively misplaced our direction to focus on the outward sources rather than the inward struggle.

Assemble the panini by spreading on one side of each slice of bread the olive tapenade. Place the eggplant on 4 slices on bread. Top that with tomato, roasted red bell pepper and mozzarella cheese and top the 4 slices with the other bread tapenade side down. Lightly brush bread with olive oil and place on grill or panini press until golden.
There were 5 failures out of the gate. Believe me, despite what people say, you cannot eat all your kitchen wrecks. I persevered and finally made a decent loaf.
I love making images that show the environment at weddings. I think this image of Loc and Sadie's ceremony from a distance during the storm is just amazing. It says so much about them and the love their friends and family have for them. Loc and Sadie's closest family and friends stood steady in the storm, freezing (my hands froze up) and getting soaked to the bones to show their support. I know that as years pass the spiritual connection to this spot on the hillside will grow not only for Loc and Sadie, but for all who were there.

When people without a knowledge of Korean music find out that that's what I usually listen to, they will always ask me why - what makes it so special? My response is usually something lame about how it's not all that different from music available in other parts of the world before I briefly explain why that's all I listen to anyway. With <U+C7A0><U+BE44><U+B098><U+C774> I can finally give an example of something that is uniquely Korean and so far everybody I've played their music to have given a positive response.
Born Virginia Hensley and referred to by her family as “Ginny”, Patsy Cline displayed a talent for performing as early as the age of 4, when she won first prize in an amateur tap-dancing contest. It was not long afterward that she transferred her enthusiasm from dance to music, and for her eighth birthday Ginny’s mother bought a piano to provide her with a means to develop her natural musical skills. By her early teens she was singing in the choir of the family’s Baptist church and on her own at the local radio station. At the age of 13 the young girl’s life was nearly brought to end by an attack of rheumatic fever, which forced her to spend a period in an oxygen tent; she would later attribute the quality of her voice to the throat infection that resulted from her illness. Two years later her father abandoned the family and Ginny was forced to drop out of school, taking night jobs singing at clubs in addition to service jobs during the day in order to help pay the bills.
I founded Naadyn (old bandname Tape3000) in 2007. All songs are written and produced by myself. I started to learn some programs and composed melodies with a synthesizer (Microkorg). Over the years my music changed and I finally found what my sound should be like. I still record melodies, work a lot to find the right arrangement and add my voice. But the way how I produce my songs is basically the same: Sitting in my room, dim light, a computer and a synthesizer, some chocolate, three cats and a night that becomes a day.
Even if the flute gets the spotlight for most of the time, TAAB2 is still a progressive rock album at its core. The songs are very well glued together, complex and intricate. Overshadowed by the flute as they might be, the guitars still sound pretty bad ass and the drumming is top notch. Because Ian’s voice is not as good as it was in his youth, he turned to a more mellow, low tone pitched delivery and, frankly, that’s a good thing; it blends very well with the album, and it proves that Ian is the kind of artist that is very aware of his limits and writes his songs accordingly. He hasn’t turned soft, if that’s what you’re thinking, nor has his music suffered a decline in quality – it’s just a tad different from what he used to do and it suits him well.
I've owned Grimaldus and Retinue since I got back into the hobby (oh, going on mid-fourth edition now). Sadly, because he's a bit cumbersome compared to much cheaper units, he's been languishing in his box all these many years.

Renaud Lavillenie. Lavillenie increased his best from 18' 6" to 19' 8.25" - becoming a serious threat to the 20 foot barrier. He brings his considerable skills to New York where he will go up against Tim Mack who has an identical PR set back in 2004. Add 19' 2.50" vaulter Derek Miles to the mix and we should see some very high attempts in New York.

I'd been given permission to look and enjoy everything in the exhibition without the trappings of historical context or academic knowledge . . . they were here to tell a new story and one that involved the exhibition visitor on a pilgrimage to the tomb of the unknown craftsman – a representative maker who, like the unknown soldier in Westminster Abbey, represents all the men and women who skillfully created the thousands of artifacts in the collections of the British Museum.

Rudyard Kipling achieved fame quickly, based initially on his first stories and poems written in India (he returned there after College), and his great popularity with the British public continued despite subsequent critical reaction to some of his more conservative work, and critical opinion in later years that his poetry was superficial and lacking in depth of meaning.

An addendum. I’m going to do something that will shock and disturb. I’m going to say congratulations to the Guardian for opening up the First Book Awards to *all* books, however published. Fantastic.

But then, we hit the kicker--tort liability and the potential undermining of the First Amendment. We've already seen several high profile libel cases in recent years. Remember Carol Burnett v The National Enquirer, Inc? This was a landmark case, especially for celebrities, who had been spectacularly unsuccessful in libel cases prior to this. What made the case so important was the court's determination that the Enquirer had employed "actual malice" and that, because they didn't comply with the California regulations for newspapers, and as thus were liable for punitive damages despite the retraction they'd printed. After some pretty strenuous searching on my part, I haven't found any undermining of the First Amendment due to this tort liability. (I have, however, noticed that the National Enquirer has been tippy-toeing in its claims about celebrities since.)

Last night I finally headed to the grocery store, as I decided it was crucial to have more than mustard and sriracha hanging out in my fridge.

I think you’ll find that the first episode of Brew Masters shows Sam Calagione to be a personable, fun-loving but hard-working guy; an image you probably picked up on in the documentary film Beer Wars, as well.
A couple of weeks ago my writing took a bit of a blow; having had a spectacular start to the masters course with A+ grades and general good feelings about my work coming from most angles, I decided to take some risks with my subject matter and style. I thought I had stepped up my game, I felt my prose had taken on a poetic aspect and I was writing the strange, macabre tales I would love to read. But, without any prior notice, my grade dropped rather significantly. Perhaps the risks were a mistake, or perhaps the process of marking creative writing will always be a subjective practice no matter how greatly objectivity is pursued. Either way I didn’t take the criticism very well. I called my friends who met me immediately in the pub for five hours of Articulate (possibly the best board game ever) and copious amounts of cloudy cider. Hugging the toilet bowl the following morning, a promise I had made myself a few years ago not to turn to alcohol in times of rejection/massive self-pity resurfaced. A little too late maybe, but I reaffirmed it that day all the same.

I have a new friend. I'll call him Adrian. Hello, Adrian - I'm sure you will recognise yourself, even with this different name. Adrian has written a long novel which he has been working on for much of this year. He has had feedback from several readers, some with publishing industry experience, so their comments are more likely to be useful than those of random friends and family. He has taken on board all their comments and made changes to his novel. I have not read his novel, nor do I intend to until it is published. I have read and commented on the synopsis and the first page - that's all. So can I be any use to Adrian in helping him develop his novel? I think so. Because I don't think I can teach him to write, but I might be able to help him to learn to write.

Somewhere in the middle there I gave up on this book, and didn’t write a word for almost a year. I thought I was done. It was just too hard, and I wasn’t cut out to be a writer. In fact, that was part of the logic in going to South America. I thought if walking down those streets again couldn’t rekindle the fire I first felt, nothing would. It was a gamble, but when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.

Throughout the album, there are moments of musical bliss that supersede any of the narrative or thematic content, such as the violins swelling up ecstatically at the 2:05 marker of "Saro", the many extended rings of piano and banjo in "Wild Bill Jones", the crack of Amidon's voice as he stretches for the high notes in "O Death", or the growing sense of anticipation expressed by the growing number of instruments in "All is Well". Nico Muhly, whose 2008 watermark of modern classical Mothertongue was among the many albums I considered for this Record Club pick, has an instinctive feel for orchestration that seems to be heightened when paired with other artists, so much so that as much as Muhly's sensibilities challenge Amidon, Amidon's spare folk forces Muhly to temper his sometimes madcap and unrestricted tendencies. Combining the legato string arrangements of Arvo Pärt, the fluttery bells and whistles of Sufjan Stevens, and the forceful repetitions of Phillip Glass yet maintaining a distinctive oddness of his own, Muhly brings surprising beauty to these songs, a measure of pastoral charm and fairy-tale whimsy that is able to dance around Amidon's voice in unpredictable but never overbearing ways. Furthemore, Valgeir's touches, less noticeable but no less affecting, offer subliminal hints of modern electronica and electro-acoustic improvisation, not to mention his high-fidelity engineering of the record gives great room for the instruments to reverberate in space.
“Where are you from?” I asked. He told me he was from Turkey and what his academic interests were. He then asked me where I was from and where I went to school. I responded that I was born and raised in Norfolk, and that I went to the university in my backyard for my bachelor’s and master’s. He repeated what I said for clarification; I confirmed it; and his response was, “That’s strange.”
ROFLMBO!! I'm finally getting around to posting this pic (kinda forgot about this, I mean her birthday was December). Ever have one of those days (or months!) where you just kind of lose all track of time...I kept saying I'd post this but, oh well, better late than never (i think that's my life's mantra, LOL). I sent her the card along with a great little insulated lunch bag! I found the bag at Stein-mart around Christmas and immediately thought about my Sis (oh did I mention, she's MUCH older than me!!).

There is also a photograph of a man standing at a press table in the middle of an empty arena, his hand covering his face in expressionistic gesture. This man seems like discoursing minister, full of pomp and rhetoric, and what occurs here is quite interesting. Does Pfeiffer suggest that signifiers of video and spectacle inducing media cover up feelings in society that seem to be much like old fashion worship? Are basketball players and media figures our temporary gods, replaced each night by new symbols? There is pessimism at work here.
This book discusses the animal zodiac and tries to explain some of the different animals. Ahead of time, I check to see which year each child was born (you think they would know, but many don't!).

Kapil Sibbal, Union Minister for HRD, said, “India is seeing rapid economic activity and growth. Developing India’s youth and their skills is going to play an important role in the country’s inclusive growth. The union budget also laid emphasis on skill development and so does the proposed 12th Five Year Plan with a National Policy on Skill development. The PPP model (public-private partnership) is most essential in running and managing training institutions to address the skill gap most efficiently. Microsoft’s commitment to empower students by deploying Microsoft Live@edu for 7.5 million users across the country with AICTE is commendable and a step towards an informed and developing India. I congratulate both AICTE and Microsoft on this significant milestone.”

For quite awhile it seemed that my teenagers' only "subject" was bodyboarding! Outside of that it seemed they just "loafed around", spent time on Facebook, watched TV etc. I felt concerned for awhile. OK, I admit it, I was very concerned. I was worried that they "weren't learning anything". I kept suggesting things they could be "doing" but was usually met with a less-than-enthusiastic response. I kept trying to think of ways to bring more things into their life in keeping with their passion. I subscribed them to bodyboarding magazines (English: check), I bought a book they seemed interested in called "The Science of Surfing" (English/Science: check) etc...... I'm sure those things helped, but what was most important, I think, was to really learn to TRUST. Not to fear.

And of course he’s busy at work today so he isn’t able to text me back like he usually would be able to, which is going to mean this will drag out all fucking day.

Take the L train to Graham Ave. (Brooklyn!) Walking directions are as follows: Walk East on Metropolitan Avenue towards Humboldt. You want to get to Woodpoint Road, so you can do that by taking the awkward diagonal Maspeth Ave, which is definitely faster. If you miss it, just turn right on Conselyea Street. Turn left on Woodpoint, and walk walk walk northeast, until you hit Kingsland Ave, then turn left again. As you approach the not-so-sexy underbelly of the BQE, you should find the magic street Lombardy and turn right! Walk on Lombardy until you hit 171 Lombardy, and you've found it. If you feel like "uh, this is weird, there's like, nothing around here but warehouses and stuff," you're totally in the right place! You should see our doorman hanging around by the door.

Martha and Cynthia were left with the two thousand pound cost of flying their Aunt’s body back home for burial, in addition to the debts she had racked up in the six years of travelling. It had not been a particularly good time. Still, if she was going to go, Martha thought, she’d like to go out with a bang; like frivolous Aunt Cece, only perhaps without the yellow pallor and translucent, wrinkled skin. Martha consoled herself that she didn’t look her age, and prayed that she could at least keep her good looks until the time came.
So she isolated herself from boys to become independent and learn how to love herself. About a year went by, and this new young defined now 17 year old young lady was set out into the unpredictable world.

I stumbled across a number of modern quilting blogs and was just floored by the bold use of colour and pattern, and the striking difference between these quilts (and quilters) and the more traditional ones I knew quite well from my graduate work in Folklore (material culture studies was one of my secondary fields).

There is also a photograph of a man standing at a press table in the middle of an empty arena, his hand covering his face in expressionistic gesture. This man seems like discoursing minister, full of pomp and rhetoric, and what occurs here is quite interesting. Does Pfeiffer suggest that signifiers of video and spectacle inducing media cover up feelings in society that seem to be much like old fashion worship? Are basketball players and media figures our temporary gods, replaced each night by new symbols? There is pessimism at work here.
There are secondary causes. In a Newsnight discussion David Starkey, put the riots down to the corrupting influence of particular type of Black culture. (7) He was attacked on the programme even by the supposedly neutral presenter Emily Maitlis and later by another partial senior BBC figure, Robert Peston. Then a 100 academics wrote a letter attacking him to The Telegraph.
The dialogue delivery was a pain all through the movie. Dev Patel was an eye sore and the Bollywood style romance with Frieda Pinto seemed utterly out of place. Everything he did rang hollow: every piece of dialogue, every bit of action, everything. Let us be honest. Dev Patel would not last five minutes in a Mumbai slum. It all seemed fictitious and unbelievable to me.
Since being practically forced into doing a bold lip everyday for work, I've fallen in love with lipstick so much that I continue to do bold lip looks on my days off! I could very easily go months without doing a bold eyeshadow look, but then my blog would be reallllly boring. Thankfully I have quite a few dramatic eye looks backlogged that I can post :)

I live in a community of people that I’m sure want this country to be a great place to live both now and in the future for our children and grandchildren. Yet when I watch our leaders and media, the focus seems to be primarily on our political differences. Some of us believe that the risks of climate change make it the most urgent issue that we must address together. Others believe it is our economy or big government that are the urgent issues to address. I find myself disheartened and doubting that our leaders have any idea of how to change the polarized game of politics and to make meaningful progress.
Making people feel like a child, and using words that depict them as children, has been a favorite way to demean and belittle people and show everyone that this group is below the normal “adult” parts of society. This immediately sets the stage for that group of the society to be treated below the other parts of society. When this happens, it becomes ok to mistreat, demean, destroy, and otherwise commit violence on this group because they are children who need to be put in their place.
The fact that the 10-year period certain option costs very little extra is a factor, too, he says. For example, a $100,000 SPIA purchased by a 65-year-old man above would pay roughly $574 a month if he buys a $100,000 life-only SPIA, but only $23 less ($553 a month) if the SPIA is a life with 10-year period certain products.

Left behind in the wake of Netanyahu’s surprise unity maneuver are some serious winners and loser. There is no doubt that elections would have shaken things up, but this unity coalition shakes up things even more. What Netanyahu managed to do today is of historic proportions and has some serious ramifications for many people on both a personal and national level. We present to you our list of winners and losers.

Dad said nothing. He put the tree to the side of the house and went off again to find another one. This went ahead every year. Dad would find a tree and bring it back for Mom’s approval. It usually took three or four attempts before Mom decided she liked the first one best. Dad would then strip some boughs from the others before putting them on the wood pile. He bored holes in the trunk of the Christmas tree and inserted the extra boughs to fill it out.
The same lady that had been sitting at the number desk was now my helper. I laid out all the paper work I had and my old license plate. She grabbed the top paper and proceeded to tell me that was the wrong document. Then I handed her the temporary registration from the dealership. She stared at me like I had three eyes.

Well, maybe this is my mother’s side in me revealing itself. Asians normally practice a winner takes all and loser loses all culture. You wipe out all your enemies and their family members for seven generations. The British prisoners of war, however, salute their German captors who are higher in rank than them. Yes, you might be a prisoner of the Germans, but if that German officer is senior in rank to you, then you salute him. That is the British way.
Germany’s EU commissioner Günther Oettinger said Europe should send blue helmets to take control of Greek tax collection and liquidate state assets. They had better be well armed. The headlines in the Greek press have been “Unconditional Capitulation”, and “Terrorization of Greeks”, and even “Fourth Reich”. #6 Everyone knows that Greece simply cannot last much longer without continued bailouts. John Mauldin explained why this is so in a recent article….
This is an almost-after shot of my new-to-me rattan furniture. The seats are covered in a stripe that matches the floral on the couch, but I still need to cover all the back cushions (which I bought ready-made for $10 each, because I can't make them for that) in the floral, which was back-ordered and which I have finally received.
I’m trying to stay rational about this. Guys talk shit about girls all the time, and they like to brag about their conquests. Part of what he was saying to Jason was complimentary. But I re-read that shit at least a dozen times to make sure I wasn’t overreacting, and I’m pretty sure I know what I saw. And of course he’s busy at work today so he isn’t able to text me back like he usually would be able to, which is going to mean this will drag out all fucking day.

There are a few tactics used to gain subscribers. Some sites hit you with a popup as soon as you come to it, asking you to subscribe. I for one abhor these popups (to spite claims they work), because if I haven’t even read your content yet, no way am I going to start handing you my information (even tho I am sure you will respect all my privacy). Some people put content plugs in their material for subscribers (it is on the right, it says “Follow the madness.”). But I have my doubts shameless plugs will do it either.

One of the things I love about the human heart is that it’s wired to help others when they’re in need. I see this repeated over and over: when a natural disaster strikes a town, or when a terrible wrong is committed against someone who’s done right, or when a beloved friend passes away. When people see a need, they often respond with caring hearts.
It must be that time of year because I know a lot of people who are in need of a get well card...everything from the stomach bug to broken bones. So I decided to use the cheerful Oops-a-Daisy set to create a simple set of Get Well cards. I started by matching up the ink colors to the Jillibean Homemade 6 Bean Soup patterned paper. I stamped the flowers in Colorbox Yellow Citrus, Maroon, Rouge, and Prima Turquoise Stone. Then I cut out the flower with the coordinating Oops-a-Daisy die. I cut ovals with the Spellbinders oval set and airbrushed inside the die line with Copics. I stamped the stem and leaves with Colorbox Lime Pastel ink and then popped the daisy up on foam tape. I wanted to keep it really simple so I just layered onto a scalloped oval and added a little ribbon to finish them off.
Today was the best TRC day ever! (by the way the trc is where we go to teach investigators) we played some simon say in ukrainian, it took us 30 min just to get out side which the door was only 30 min away. We had the TRC tonight and I taught in 100% ukrainian and I wasnt nervous at all... well I was for the first half then I calmed down and it went really well, we coud even feel the spirit :) I know the Lord helped me today. oh yeah I forgot my Companion Elder Flint traded a B.o.M for a tie haha it was so funny!
During the first month of Eva’s life, I found myself saying “No more”, or “This is the last one, how could I do this with a two year old at home?” What sane person choses to put their sanity to the brink after they’ve been through it? Unless, of course, you forget about it.

I learned something about myself today. Well, a few things. Because I don’t normally run on a treadmill in front of a mirror, I hadn’t realized how lean and muscular my quads got in the last 6 months. I had no choice but to notice it today as the rower was positioned in front of a full mirror. Simply walking to the rower to clean off my well-hydrated puddles of sweat, I had no choice but to notice my quads flex with each step. I even have the V above the knee. I’ve never noticed this before.

#738 - Tabu, A Story of the South Seas (1931) - (#228 on TSPDT) This Muranu film (co-directed of sorts with Robert Flaherty), the director's final film, released just after his death, is the highest ranked film in this update, and for the most part (excepting the two Renoir and Flaherty's own Louisiana Story) deserves to be. A fascinating look at tribal culture and law in the form of a tragic romance. History tells us that Flaherty was not happy with Murnau's screenplay - calling it too westernized - but even with this dissent, the combination of the German auteur's directorial prowess and Flaherty's naturalistic filmmaking style, make for a surprisingly intriguing work of cinematic art. I suppose considering this is a film from these two men, I should not be all that surprised at its bravura standing.
Until next time..........Hugs, Regi

Pinterest lets users organize and share images or videos that interest them from the Web. Users will segment their boards into different categories in order to keep their images and video organized. Since this is an open/viral community, what this means for our clients is that people browse pinboards created by other people. The point being discovery – users can discover new items and gain inspiration from others.

Socks are a microcosm of my futile attempts to control my clutter. There they are…piled high in a basket as if they have some meaning in our lives.

Yet, there were other early influences in my father’s life, ones that spoke of need and want. Born in 1918, he went through the Depression as a young man, and knew hunger and hardship first hand. While my mother regaled my sisters and I with stories of simple Christmases on her childhood farm in rural New York State, my father kept silent. Only later, when I was an adult, did he share the truth of having had little or nothing.
One way to make the most of social networking sites is to tie them to attractive sales promotions. People will want to like your Facebook page if they know this is a good way to have access to discounts. Social networking sites should be used so that your customers can have a better understand of you and your company. They should also start to be a little more closely involved with your products and brands.

6. The Normalization of Surveillance. The fear of being surveilled makes a population easier to control. While the National Security Agency (NSA) has received publicity for monitoring American citizen’s email and phone conversations, and while employer surveillance has become increasingly common in the United States, young Americans have become increasingly acquiescent to corporatocracy surveillance because, beginning at a young age, surveillance is routine in their lives. Parents routinely check Web sites for their kid’s latest test grades and completed assignments, and just like employers, are monitoring their children’s computers and Facebook pages. Some parents use the GPS in their children’s cell phones to track their whereabouts, and other parents have video cameras in their homes. Increasingly, I talk with young people who lack the confidence that they can even pull off a party when their parents are out of town, and so how much confidence are they going to have about pulling off a democratic movement below the radar of authorities?
The initial driver for fortnightly collections of residual waste, such as that placed in green bins in Amber Valley, was an apparent shortage of landfill sites to bury waste. However, a reduction in costs for the collecting authority is also a major factor in the decision to reduce collection frequency. It is also obvious that reducing residual waste capacity forces many households to recycle more of their waste.

Also at Westminster we find a list headed ‘Stuffe brought frome the late Erle of Essex House at the Austen Freers Attaynted’ – this Earl of Essex being Thomas Cromwell, who was executed six and a half years before Henry’s own death. The list of ‘stuffe’ kept includes beds & bedlinen. There is also, at Greenwich, a bedstead decorated with the cipher of Queen Jane, on which the valances and counterpane are decorated with the cipher of Queen Anne. Which Queen Anne (Boleyn, or of Cleves) isn't specified - but could anyone really have had restful slumber in such a spot?!

The mainstream view of Brian De Palma's 2000s output is anything but flattering, with all four of his films made in the new millennium bowing to intense critical pans and commercial indifference. However, I've found his contemporary work to rank among his best. Mission to Mars captures the boundless enthusiasm (and unabashed cheesiness) of old Disney space adventures, shot to favor near-poetry over scientific accuracy and all the better for it. Femme Fatale threw people with its narrative mulligan, but it made the strongest case to date for the director's actual feelings for women, which are far more complex than the lazy accusations of misogyny that have dogged him for so long. The Black Dahlia is, if anything, the only one of De Palma's films that can even stand with Carlito's Way in terms of sheer aesthetic and Romantic beauty. Its sloppy elements and awkward acting choices only add to its deliberate, yet gentle, attack on Hollywood. It may also be the most neatly contextualized of De Palma's films in his strange canon, fitting neatly with the more formal, big-budget experiments and the uncompromising anti-mainstream tone of his '70s and '80s work.

Before the 1830s, trains had not yet spread widely across the English country side and many factories still relied on canals for the transport of raw materials and goods to market. The postal system and its need to carry mail and people along particular routes required reform and refurbishment of the infrastructure during the late Regency period. Thomas Telford and John McAdam (of the Tar-McAdam or tarmac fame despite his not using tar in his construction, but possibly because of family business in the 18th century involving tar and shipbuilding) led to widespread renovations and improvements (in terms of the roads taking people where they wanted to go) on the Roman roads, including the Great North Road, the corridor between London and Edinburgh that is now called the A1.

"It could only happen on Top Of The Pops - it's classical guitar" If you like, Jimmy. "Where could you get such class except Top Of The Pops?" rhetorically asks a man who chose to dress like that. Both parties sit, the crowd stand pensively around the perimeter of a small circular stage I don't think we've ever seen before. It's pretty much what you'd expect Feelings performed by Cleo Laine with John Williams to sound like, a reminder that throughout this decade you'd get stuff well out of the pop loop - the Shadows were regulars well into the 80s - in an attempt to paint the show as inclusive and classy. The response is appropriately Two Ronnies audience-like.

Even if the flute gets the spotlight for most of the time, TAAB2 is still a progressive rock album at its core. The songs are very well glued together, complex and intricate. Overshadowed by the flute as they might be, the guitars still sound pretty bad ass and the drumming is top notch. Because Ian’s voice is not as good as it was in his youth, he turned to a more mellow, low tone pitched delivery and, frankly, that’s a good thing; it blends very well with the album, and it proves that Ian is the kind of artist that is very aware of his limits and writes his songs accordingly. He hasn’t turned soft, if that’s what you’re thinking, nor has his music suffered a decline in quality – it’s just a tad different from what he used to do and it suits him well.

Flybe has also launched a new ‘Essential’ ticket system, at £19 cheaper than economy, this allows people to buy lower priced tickets for just taking carry on items with them, whilst still earning frequent flyer points. Economy and Economy Plus pretty much stay the same. The loss of the debit card charge will really make prices transparent and actually maybe even surprise consumers when they finally pay for the ticket, not having random surcharges appear just before they click on the ‘pay now’ button.

Three weeks away and much as changed. Spring has snuck into Nordkapp. To visitors traveling through, they may disagree.

They say in AA that the first step is admitting that you have a problem. I’ve never been to AA but I have to think they must be right. It seems pretty obvious. After all, you can’t exactly fight something before you realize it’s something that needs to be fought. I definitely have problem. I have ADD and I’m stressed. I can’t focus, I can’t relax, and I feel like I have no control over my life and what I actually want out of it. So here I am. I’m on a self-inflicted seclusion in the middle of nowhere, smack-dab in the middle of the great ol’ US of A. The town is called Moorhead and it’s in Minnesota, bordering North Dakota and slightly bigger town called Fargo. You may have heard about it. They made a movie. I won’t bore you with the details of my expedition, or berate you with the fact that Fargo (the movie) was actually a misnomer because it was the Minnesota, that is, Moorhead, police that actually solved the crime (actually, in retrospect, I guess I will). I also won’t bore you with the all details of my drive, yes drive, out here which include two and a half days of my cat meowing (yes, she meowed the whole way). I still hear her in my head. Meow. Meoooow. Meoowwww. As if a chainsaw was cutting her in half, while she was being choked by fishing line, and I was just watching. Trust me, none of that happened.

As with most studies, there are limitations to the data. The study focused on data from registries instead of actual ADHD patients. Data was collected for more than 150,000 individuals currently taking drugs such as Ritalin or Concerta. These persons were compared to 434,000 people who were not taking these medications. The researchers found that over 1,300 participants had a heart attack, stroke, or cardiac related death. However, the drugs were not an increased risk to the deaths. In addition, neither age nor a history of heart disease added risk to ADHD drug users. Researchers also found that the deaths were the same during the use of an ADHD drug and a year after use had ceased.

I mean, you don't have to be a rocket scientist. You can't make this shit up. My son was labeled autistic when he was 3 years old. The ONLY expert I listened to was Temple Grandin. She led me much more lovingly through trecherous waters than the psychiatrists Ben had. Except for the one who was ADHD himself. He used to tell my son he was the hardest worker he knew. And school is very, very hard for our kids who think differently, who think right-brained, visuallly, as some describe it. These Hunters in a Farmers world.

My wife and I are one of many same-sex couples who lived under a strange compromise. I'll try to recap succinctly. We married in Massachusetts on December 31, 2004. Our marriage was legally invalidated by judges because we were not residents of Massachusetts, and there was a law against letting out-of-state couples marry there if their marriage would be illegal in their home state. (The original intent of the law was to prevent interracial couples from traveling out-of-state to marry in Massachusetts, which demonstrates how intertwined all sorts of oppression are.) Then that law was overturned, and around the same time, the State of New York began to honor marriages that had been contracted *out* of state. As in, one couldn't legally marry a same-sex partner in New York, but could marry out of state. L'Ailee and I went back to Massachusetts as close as we could to our anniversary and re-married.

I was reading a thriller the other day, one of those convoluted stories with a dozen endings as if the author couldn’t figure out which ending he wanted to use. There were three crimes, all dealing with the same group of people yet none of the crimes were related. One of the crimes was a kidnapping, and though I know who did the kidnapping, the story was so complicated I still don’t know who instigated it. Despite all the flaws of the book, the one thing that took me out of the story was a typo. The author tried to set the scene using smells — the aroma of an expensive cigar, the smell of leather chairs, the scent of Channel Number 5 lingering in the air.

I praise the Lord for this reverent caution that he has given me and I need to realize that this kind of dependence is what should always characterize my heart, but the handful of weeks that I get to preach each year make me fearful of that time when I will preach almost every week. See, our church is planning on sending me out to another community close by to plant a church in the not too distant future and I will take on the responsibility of weekly bringing God’s truth to his people. My fear is that I will get used to preaching. By “get used to” I don’t mean a familiarity with preaching that will allow me to loosen up in the pulpit and preach with more focus and conviction. Rather, by “get used to” I mean that familiarity with preaching by which I stop depending on God so much and start depending on myself. I’m fearful of getting used to preaching in such a way that leads me to lose that sense of reverence for God’s Word and start flying by the seat of my pants as I proclaim it.

It is funny how many people that I interact with on an almost daily basis have commented that they didn't feel that they really knew me until they read my blog. I guess you could say that I am a bit socially reclusive. I am, believe it or not, shy. Once I get to know you and feel comfortable, all bets are off, but until I break through that barrier of fear, in person I probably seem a little stand-off-ish.

But 40% of those deemed ineligible are appealing against their ruling, with more than a third of them successfully overturning the verdict – which has led to a call for more judges to process the caseload.

I chose the idea that it’s all about the baby steps to get there. Sometimes, you just have to do just one thing, even if it doesn’t seem like something big. Even the littlest thing or ten minutes at a time can bring you closer to your goals. That’s why I changed my goal of “Finish Something” to “Work on the mermaids painting for twenty minutes a week last week.” I guess I only hit ten minutes the last two weeks, but it was better than the nothing at all I was doing before.
In my short life thus far I have come to understand that thanksgiving takes on its highest meaning following experiences like suffering, chaos, deprivation, poverty and loss.
“I love deviled eggs and they are so versatile, making a great snack, breakfast, lunch, hors d’oeuvres Take a hard boiled egg, rolling it to get the shell off without butchering the white part, slicing in half, taking out the yolk and mixing it with mayonnaise, mustard, and salt and pepper. Or…mix it with wasabi, minced veggies or other flavorings. Or…forget the yolk altogether and stuff the whites with hummus, crab salad, etc.”

This test will be of individual words and non-words. Pupils will be asked to show that they can offer the correct readings for the real words and plausible readings for the non-words ie pronouncing the letters and letter-combinations with the sounds that the children have been taught. So, for example a non-word with the 'ou' letters in the middle could be pronounced either as 'ou' in 'sound' or as 'ou' in 'wound' (as in 'hurt') (all southern English pronunciations). Whether they could pronounce it as the 'ou' in 'touch' is, I think, unlikely. We shall see whether 'rare' pronunciations will be allowed when the actual test comes out.

We went to the club with some of MOH’s clients for dinner. The club is a lovely place. It looks like part of a motel. There were all these fancy things on the menu to eat, I should have thought about what I could eat so that I could eat quickly and gracefully. I was so intent on NOT embarrassing MOH with my ‘Food shoveling habits’, which have been acquired while waiting on children who eat much quicker than me, that I don’t eat a third of my order, because I was so desperately trying not to make a mess of myself. I ordered angel hair, not a good choice for trying to eat gracefully. I should have ordered the chicken, I would have been terrifically happy with the chicken, but I never make myself seafood anymore because Daughter #1 is allergic to shrimp, so I don’t bring it into the house to make it for myself. I ordered the seafood dinner because MOH was so excited about it, and I was SO out-of-place that I couldn’t think straight. I’m not like a, “What will they think of me?” kind of person. I’m more concerned that they will think poorly of MOH for having a complete baboon who can’t carry conversation for a wife. My kids were all freaked out because I actually wore make up and jewelry. At one point in the conversation, there was discussion of a new resteraunt in town. Of course, I was the ONLY one at the table who had never been there. Even MOH had eaten there with a client. MOH said, “You have to excuse her she doesn’t get out much.” To which I replied, “I get out, just not to the same places you all would go.” (Talk about adding to the self-consciousness. Thanks love. Again, not one of his shining moments of brilliance, but forgivable.) This after I launched my fork onto the ground, how I may never know, and the matron of the party fetched another from the table across from us for me. (I must have turned Coke can red.)
On June 16th 1968, Romney was involved in a serious car crash which occurred in Bernos-Beaulac, 75 kilometres to the south of Bordeaux. He was at the wheel of the car which was bringing Mormon French mission president Duane Anderson and others back from Pau, where a small Mormon congregation had been in dispute.

As with most right wing thinking, austerity is born from a lack of thought. It is a simple fact that cutting services means fewer jobs and raising taxes means people are worse off. The more unemployed you have the greater the drain on the economy, as the Government has to pay benefits but receive no taxes. The unemployment benefit is so laughable that people on it can’t usually spend anything outside of the basics, and so the economy loses out on sales, and the government loses out on VAT. Next, because the media constantly tells us we are in recession again, those people with jobs save their money. When they don’t spend, the shops lose out and in the worst cases have to enter insolvency, thus throwing another group of people out into unemployment. Cut, paste, repeat.

I move onto devotions. Surely, I’ll get into some deep meaning in scripture. My reading is Romans 5:8 … “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”
The base is very important, too, so I suggest a Ming the Merciless vibe. That will certainly appeal to those who cheer executions and don’t care if a woman bleeds to death, because she was denied an abortion at an emergency room…

Wow! That is a pretty big challenge. There is a reason it is called “the shadow”. It can be a bit scary to take an honest look at what we are feeling and why. Isn’t it easier to sit in judgment and blame someone else than to take 100% responsibility for our own thoughts and actions? Ya, I think so too! But I have realized in recent days, months, years that I need to take 100% accountability for everything that happened or continues to happen in my life. Whether it’s the abuse I endured as a child, the issues in my marriage, or what I perceive to be happening within the roller derby league I was practicing with. This book reiterates what I already believe and that is that “thoughts are things” and we create our own world based on our thoughts. When I think, “Well they don’t like me and are ignoring me and leaving me out because they don’t like me” then it sets that “wish” into motion and sure enough I get more of what I perceived to be true. This just shows me that I am feeling separate from others….separate from my self…separate from God/Love. Where there is separation, there is fear. Where there is fear, there is the shadow. Where there is shadow, there is dis-ease, pain, sadness.

The incident has raised concerns for the medical-marijuana community in California, particularly the Harborside Health Center, a regulated dispensary also based in Oakland, which also happens to be the largest in the World. Harborside has had various threats from the IRS over the last two years regarding its business conduct, documented in ‘Weed Wars’, a program broadcast on the Discovery Channel. Assessing the situation from afar it seems noticeable that the authorities chose to attack the university (instead of just a dispensary) – perhaps because of their free licence to spread information on private production of cannabis and profiteering as a business, rather than just selling and distributing the drug. To try and determine the objectives of the authorities and federal agents who organised the raid, their concern on this front seems more understandable; the desire to exercise their power and eliminate personal usage whilst discrediting the facts and existing information.

Formal confirmation as to whether the action has been raised in England or Scotland is awaited.

Another night as I walked home from the subway the long-setted sun had left the sky dark, but some high-flying clouds in the eastern sky were still burning faintly with an orange glow. The sun’s light had refracted around our world and illuminated the floating vapour in an illusive light. I realized that the description of why it was happening was less beautiful than the fact that it was. So I stopped and looked up at the cool-orange glow and thought about nothing.

Driven shows all the hallmarks of Sallis’ succint prose and spot on pacing. However, the ambiguous plot points wore thin after awhile. Instead of opening up the text, the atmospheric, cerebral writing closed it off. But maybe I just wasn’t in the right mood for this book at the time I read it. Maybe I was searching for easy reading, a paint by numbers. (I read this after running a half-marathon. It’s hard to enjoy a book when phantom wildebeests are shredding your calf muscles with horn and head.)

Brake seem to want to teach kids that it's alright to just walk out into the road because they will have successfully removed cars from the equation. Brake was founded after a truck with dodgy brakes killed the founders mother. I am human enough to sympathise with that, I think any decent person would be but they've lost all perspective on the real World. Had they just been a group that focused on car safety improvements, I'd have no issue with them. As it is, they've taken their extreme views to an almost Biblical level, and you all know what I think to the Bible.

Martha and Cynthia were left with the two thousand pound cost of flying their Aunt’s body back home for burial, in addition to the debts she had racked up in the six years of travelling. It had not been a particularly good time. Still, if she was going to go, Martha thought, she’d like to go out with a bang; like frivolous Aunt Cece, only perhaps without the yellow pallor and translucent, wrinkled skin. Martha consoled herself that she didn’t look her age, and prayed that she could at least keep her good looks until the time came.

I have been thinking about this for a while, and despite the fact that I enjoy intellectually sharp characters, I don't require them to continue reading. At one point I even asked myself in adversarial fashion, "What, Juliette, are you really looking for characters who are exactly at your level of intelligence and can't make mistakes?"

‘Medium Fish’ campaigns I refer to as the ‘default’, since it is where most D&D campaigns spend most of their time (anywhere from levels 5-15, arguably, and even broader if the GM gets clever). Since most RPGs take their cue from D&D on some level, this is where everybody lands. The advantages of the medium fish campaign are obvious: the PCs have enough power so that they feel awesome, but not so much power that the GM feels like he or she might lose control of the party (which, in itself, is a concern better addressed other ways, but I digress). Medium Fish are a good way to keep a campaign on the rails, so to speak, and to give PCs both a keen sense of mortality coupled with some fun opportunities for derring-do and frontal-assault type heroics.

In a preview of an upcoming episode from ABC’s program, What Would You Do?, an irritated diner patron comes to the aid of a waitress being verbally harassed by another customer. The waitress ins questions, is a real transgender woman but the verbally-abusive customer is an actor. The program puts forth an interesting scenario, and one that I’m sure plays out more and more often, and it’s great to see someone standing up for the woman, who is, indeed, just trying to do her job. Interestingly, when the actor asks the irritated patron if he thinks it’s “ok for someone to be disgusting,” the patron replies, “It’s okay to be whoever you want to be. This is America.”

I have a new friend. I'll call him Adrian. Hello, Adrian - I'm sure you will recognise yourself, even with this different name. Adrian has written a long novel which he has been working on for much of this year. He has had feedback from several readers, some with publishing industry experience, so their comments are more likely to be useful than those of random friends and family. He has taken on board all their comments and made changes to his novel. I have not read his novel, nor do I intend to until it is published. I have read and commented on the synopsis and the first page - that's all. So can I be any use to Adrian in helping him develop his novel? I think so. Because I don't think I can teach him to write, but I might be able to help him to learn to write.

I have watched both versions of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo films but I haven’t read the book. So I feel like it may be an uninformed statement to say that I like the American version more than the Swedish but I do. It’s just more American or more Hollywood than the Swedish version and makes for a more thrilling and exciting movie going experience. Either way I have seen two great films based on the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. So I know the gist of the popular novel and what a wonderful and terrifying portrait of life it probably is. Lisbeth is a character that is strong and weak. She is a character that is the hero of our stories and is also the victim as she lives in a world where men control her physically and emotionally. I haven’t seen the Swedish sequels nor do I plan on reading the books but I hope that there is some redemption for Lisbeth in the end, redemption that she can mark on her body somewhere in-between the scars.

Our Constitution was not designed as a plaything for pandering demagogues to act out their altruistic Robin Hood fantasies. Government functionaries at all levels were meant to be servants of the people, with their activities closely monitored and regulated by the people – not the other way around. It only established a federation of thirteen individual sovereign states, as a combination free trade agreement (think European Union) and mutual defense pact (think NATO). Unrestrained commerce, sound money, and international relations were what was foremost on our Founders’ minds as they debated how best to govern themselves as a nation – not regulating the activities of individual citizens, whom they regarded as the true sovereigns in their classical liberal view of Natural Law. By design, the power of the Federal government to interfere in the affairs of its constituent states was extremely limited. Its ability to interfere in the routine daily lives of their citizens was virtually nonexistent.

#738 - Tabu, A Story of the South Seas (1931) - (#228 on TSPDT) This Muranu film (co-directed of sorts with Robert Flaherty), the director's final film, released just after his death, is the highest ranked film in this update, and for the most part (excepting the two Renoir and Flaherty's own Louisiana Story) deserves to be. A fascinating look at tribal culture and law in the form of a tragic romance. History tells us that Flaherty was not happy with Murnau's screenplay - calling it too westernized - but even with this dissent, the combination of the German auteur's directorial prowess and Flaherty's naturalistic filmmaking style, make for a surprisingly intriguing work of cinematic art. I suppose considering this is a film from these two men, I should not be all that surprised at its bravura standing.

But he's also a writer of tough guy, Ludlumian fiction, with titles like The Apocalypse Directive, and America's Last Days: A Novel, and with his latest book, he's facing the same dilemma confronted by every tough guy American writer from James Fenimore Cooper to Ernest Hemingway to Norman Mailer: dismissive online reviews that seek to weaken his main character's bladder control.

At 180 pages long the book has enough space to cover quite a wide range of topics and it does so. Starting with a background to the team, moving on to the cars technology, to overviews of its design and operation. With its familiar graphical style and hardback format it certainly gives the feel of a proper workshop manual. However this is somewhat skin deep and the pages within, soon revert to a more typical book on F1, although some flashes of the Haynes style do remain.

Penny Alesi recalls Idema's screams into the speakerphone and calling the persons on the receiving end vile names who preformed unspeakable sexual acts. Ms. Alesi and her “family” of three American cats were then living with Idema from March 31, 2009 - September 17, 2009; and was his close companion every single day. What she experienced in those months of horror will never be forgotten: Idema was constantly breaking phones, glasses, ashtrays, anything within reach because he was not happy with the way things were going in the States. However, he would not even attempt to return to America because he was afraid that the FBI had a sealed indictment that would put him in jail the moment he stepped foot on U.S. soil. Thus he would do all his business via phone, computer and fax. The problem was that Idema had broken rule number one of a successful con artist by drinking to excess and using illegal drugs like cocaine. As if wasn't enough to blow his cool, the dust to dawn bizarre sex escapades at his Casa Arabi that by themselves would have driven anyone over the edge.
I live in a community of people that I’m sure want this country to be a great place to live both now and in the future for our children and grandchildren. Yet when I watch our leaders and media, the focus seems to be primarily on our political differences. Some of us believe that the risks of climate change make it the most urgent issue that we must address together. Others believe it is our economy or big government that are the urgent issues to address. I find myself disheartened and doubting that our leaders have any idea of how to change the polarized game of politics and to make meaningful progress.

Endings. Again, like The House of the Devil - which I'm constantly comparing to as it's such an awesome movie - The Innkeepers somewhat challenges its audience. Did it really happen? I know of people who read the ending of The House of the Devil as a possible “dream state/imaginary” space as to say that the movie never really happened… strange yes, and I do not really agree with it either, but at the same time, I definitely feel that The Innkeepers does pose similar questions. Did it really happen or was it in the state of fear and confusion that brought it all on? The last shot lingers on for an eternity before presenting the answer. And I also find that last scene to be part of the intelligent narrative that West uses in The Innkeepers. It's not to unlike the viral video that was seen earlier. He builds to a climax with the exact same tricks that the viral video does. And this is a motif that I find runs vibrantly though the movie. Is it real or all just a trick? During the last half hour, I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a scene where Claire wakes up and it all had been a dream. Now this doesn’t happen obviously, but in some strange way there’s a feeling that it could have happened in the last act.
"Maybe theme is something to consider if you're writing 'literary' work, but I write genre."
So what is it that gives me this reaction? Well, I'll tell you now, it's not just characters with a low level of intelligence. I have been thinking about this for a while, and despite the fact that I enjoy intellectually sharp characters, I don't require them to continue reading. At one point I even asked myself in adversarial fashion, "What, Juliette, are you really looking for characters who are exactly at your level of intelligence and can't make mistakes?"
She smiled, and tried to make me feel better ”Don’t worry, you know how I rarely wear a dress? well, on my way home from your party wearing that long cocktail dress that looked soooooo hot…..”

Over the course of the week, I did daily yoga in addition to the other parts of the program which the participants mostly did at home on our own, following the instructions of the leader. For a few days, we ate a completely raw, vegan diet. We took salt water baths and drank small amounts of senna tea nightly. I napped a lot. Later in the week, we juice fasted. We did an internal salt water bath. Twice, we participated in a sweat lodge at the Lake Claire land trust.

You may ask, then, why I have chosen a ball perched atop a steep hill to represent the very foundation of contemporary society. I make no claims of any great knowledge in neurology, psychology, anthropology, or sociology, but there is one characteristic of our society that my own observations have repeatedly led me to: this hill, this very foundation, is unstable. At any point, a small amount of force applied in the right direction can start the ball rolling back down, back to stable ground, to the agrarian, community-based economics practiced for so much of human history. A small shift in day-to-day life, or the rediscovery of a older, simpler tradition that, in the hustle and bustle of modern life, we didn’t realize we had forgotten – these little events on a societal or, more likely, personal level, can start the ball rolling. Moreover, if strong enough, they can completely derail all of the artificiality, materialism, and vice which have been forced upon us (by whom?: that is a whole discussion in itself), in order to separate us from our roots and keep us in a state of near-subservience.

The incident has raised concerns for the medical-marijuana community in California, particularly the Harborside Health Center, a regulated dispensary also based in Oakland, which also happens to be the largest in the World. Harborside has had various threats from the IRS over the last two years regarding its business conduct, documented in ‘Weed Wars’, a program broadcast on the Discovery Channel. Assessing the situation from afar it seems noticeable that the authorities chose to attack the university (instead of just a dispensary) – perhaps because of their free licence to spread information on private production of cannabis and profiteering as a business, rather than just selling and distributing the drug. To try and determine the objectives of the authorities and federal agents who organised the raid, their concern on this front seems more understandable; the desire to exercise their power and eliminate personal usage whilst discrediting the facts and existing information.
Well, let’s see. There are lots of different sorts of conversations one might want to have about a claim like that: conversations, say, about what it is to explain something, and about what it is to be a law of nature, and about what it is to be a physical thing. But since the space I have is limited, let me put those niceties aside and try to be quick, and crude, and concrete.

As I went down the stairs and was marching out the door a young, pretty woman came up to me and introduced herself. She said she was Laurel Wescott Rancitelli and was running for City Council and asked if I would sign her nomination papers. She told me her campaign motto is, "A Vote for Rancitelli is a Vote for Change!" I asked her about her education and she said she has a high school diploma and an Associate's Degree from STCC. I asked her why she didn't continue her education and she replied that she got such an attractive opportunity to work at a Catholic school that she couldn't turn it down. I regret that I didn't ask her position on birth control, but I signed her paper anyway and she seemed grateful, saying that she was just beginning her campaign.

#738 - Tabu, A Story of the South Seas (1931) - (#228 on TSPDT) This Muranu film (co-directed of sorts with Robert Flaherty), the director's final film, released just after his death, is the highest ranked film in this update, and for the most part (excepting the two Renoir and Flaherty's own Louisiana Story) deserves to be. A fascinating look at tribal culture and law in the form of a tragic romance. History tells us that Flaherty was not happy with Murnau's screenplay - calling it too westernized - but even with this dissent, the combination of the German auteur's directorial prowess and Flaherty's naturalistic filmmaking style, make for a surprisingly intriguing work of cinematic art. I suppose considering this is a film from these two men, I should not be all that surprised at its bravura standing.

But then, we hit the kicker--tort liability and the potential undermining of the First Amendment. We've already seen several high profile libel cases in recent years. Remember Carol Burnett v The National Enquirer, Inc? This was a landmark case, especially for celebrities, who had been spectacularly unsuccessful in libel cases prior to this. What made the case so important was the court's determination that the Enquirer had employed "actual malice" and that, because they didn't comply with the California regulations for newspapers, and as thus were liable for punitive damages despite the retraction they'd printed. After some pretty strenuous searching on my part, I haven't found any undermining of the First Amendment due to this tort liability. (I have, however, noticed that the National Enquirer has been tippy-toeing in its claims about celebrities since.)
Wow! That is a pretty big challenge. There is a reason it is called “the shadow”. It can be a bit scary to take an honest look at what we are feeling and why. Isn’t it easier to sit in judgment and blame someone else than to take 100% responsibility for our own thoughts and actions? Ya, I think so too! But I have realized in recent days, months, years that I need to take 100% accountability for everything that happened or continues to happen in my life. Whether it’s the abuse I endured as a child, the issues in my marriage, or what I perceive to be happening within the roller derby league I was practicing with. This book reiterates what I already believe and that is that “thoughts are things” and we create our own world based on our thoughts. When I think, “Well they don’t like me and are ignoring me and leaving me out because they don’t like me” then it sets that “wish” into motion and sure enough I get more of what I perceived to be true. This just shows me that I am feeling separate from others….separate from my self…separate from God/Love. Where there is separation, there is fear. Where there is fear, there is the shadow. Where there is shadow, there is dis-ease, pain, sadness.

Before the 1830s, trains had not yet spread widely across the English country side and many factories still relied on canals for the transport of raw materials and goods to market. The postal system and its need to carry mail and people along particular routes required reform and refurbishment of the infrastructure during the late Regency period. Thomas Telford and John McAdam (of the Tar-McAdam or tarmac fame despite his not using tar in his construction, but possibly because of family business in the 18th century involving tar and shipbuilding) led to widespread renovations and improvements (in terms of the roads taking people where they wanted to go) on the Roman roads, including the Great North Road, the corridor between London and Edinburgh that is now called the A1.

Using a semi-permanent pink color + warm water we created 3 different strength pinks in 3 different bowls. (We used Special FX color in Atomic Pink. Put 2 quarter sized dabs of color in each bowl. Add 1/2 a cup of warm water to one bowl, 1 cup of warm water to the second bowl and 1 1/2 cups of warm water to the third bowl.)

In order to infuse a bit of Irish culture into our wedding, after the rehearsal dinner we decided to have a traditional seisiún (session) with a live Irish band and lots of Guinness and Irish Coffee. It was wild and we had all the guests doing ‘Riverdance’ type moves all night! The day of the wedding we rented a red double decker bus to take the wedding party and our families to and from the ceremony, it was a hit! Definitely went along with our vintage Ireland theme. We also included some traditional Irish dishes like Leek & Potato soup and Irish Smoked Salmon on the dinner menu.
Another clever question, to which the correct answer is TRUE. Notice there is no argument as to whether there really is racism in the Anglican Church, it is just presented as fact, and provides the BBC with the opportunity to subliminally brainwash whilst promoting the only Christian they admire, based solely on the fact that he is an African, an enormous positive that far outweighs the inconvenient fact that he is far more hard line than the liberal rank and file excuses for the British Clergy epitomised by the Archdruid, Rowan Williams.

As with most studies, there are limitations to the data. The study focused on data from registries instead of actual ADHD patients. Data was collected for more than 150,000 individuals currently taking drugs such as Ritalin or Concerta. These persons were compared to 434,000 people who were not taking these medications. The researchers found that over 1,300 participants had a heart attack, stroke, or cardiac related death. However, the drugs were not an increased risk to the deaths. In addition, neither age nor a history of heart disease added risk to ADHD drug users. Researchers also found that the deaths were the same during the use of an ADHD drug and a year after use had ceased.

This week I’ve been listening to my Trevor Morgan CD “The Blessed and the Broken” in my car in preparation for the Third Day concert in May, because Trevor is opening for Third Day. It was actually at Fish Fest last summer that I first heard him when he played just a few songs at the beginning of Third Day’s set.
That said, when I go back and think about how the film was edited, I’d be hard-pressed to say what I would add back in while keeping the violence level toned down — not a lot of gore in the film as opposed to the book — and the film at a reasonable length.

So I spent a lot of the time on the web seeing tons of amazing inspiration. I got most of my inspiration from Cat at Constant in Chaos. Her vintage play kitchen really spoke to me, specifically the farmhouse sink and the retro styling on the refrigerator. So after getting all the inspiration I needed, I designed my plans and set off to Grandma and Grandpa's house. Grandpa did most of the actual building (I really tried to help cause I wanted to use this as a teaching exercise for my woodworking skills, but he is not a very patient teacher and likes to just do it himself.

I think pitch correction is OK as long as you don't hear it. Some band would suck without pitch correction, most R&B bands, and others would lose their character, (like) Sonic Youth. I would recommend to singer to smoke a lot and drink a lot - not when singing, though. Also it can be helpful to play the melody on a piano and sing with it to get the notes right in the head. I am not a good singer and sometimes on stage I can be very "shaky". Mostly because of stress. . . getting better though.
Seriously, this dessert is soooo good! If you are grilling, pop those peaches on the grill! My dinner guest loved it and literally couldn’t believe that it only took me 5 minutes to prep in the kitchen while they were relaxing. And, if you have any left overs the roasted fruit was super yummy the next morning on my yogurt!

If she were such a hardened criminal, why was she only carrying mace? If she were heavily into the drug lifestyle or possibly selling drugs, she would have been carrying a gun as well. It’s not unthinkable for a convicted felon to have a gun. In some cases, the ones who shouldn’t have them, it’s easier for them to obtain.

At one point, after her debate with Biden, the movie shows her watching late coverage, and landing on Pat Buchanan praising her for being “attractive” and “personable.” She can’t look away. It’s the first nice thing she’s heard about herself in months, and she takes it in with terrible hunger. She looks at Pat fucking Buchanan like a starving person looking at a plate full of cheeseburgers.

When I remember back on things that make me feel guilty I tend to remember them as if I’m looking at myself from outside my body. It's a false sense of memory, perhaps a way to deal with the guilt. There are many things I don’t remember at all. My brother is good at telling me things I said years ago that I can't remember in any shape or form. Maybe I don't remember those because they didn’t make me feel guilty.

But he's also a writer of tough guy, Ludlumian fiction, with titles like The Apocalypse Directive, and America's Last Days: A Novel, and with his latest book, he's facing the same dilemma confronted by every tough guy American writer from James Fenimore Cooper to Ernest Hemingway to Norman Mailer: dismissive online reviews that seek to weaken his main character's bladder control.

#738 - Tabu, A Story of the South Seas (1931) - (#228 on TSPDT) This Muranu film (co-directed of sorts with Robert Flaherty), the director's final film, released just after his death, is the highest ranked film in this update, and for the most part (excepting the two Renoir and Flaherty's own Louisiana Story) deserves to be. A fascinating look at tribal culture and law in the form of a tragic romance. History tells us that Flaherty was not happy with Murnau's screenplay - calling it too westernized - but even with this dissent, the combination of the German auteur's directorial prowess and Flaherty's naturalistic filmmaking style, make for a surprisingly intriguing work of cinematic art. I suppose considering this is a film from these two men, I should not be all that surprised at its bravura standing.

Somewhere in the middle there I gave up on this book, and didn’t write a word for almost a year. I thought I was done. It was just too hard, and I wasn’t cut out to be a writer. In fact, that was part of the logic in going to South America. I thought if walking down those streets again couldn’t rekindle the fire I first felt, nothing would. It was a gamble, but when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.

Then there's the stuff that isn't about hitting -- Cameron was a much faster and better base runner -- he stole almost 300 bases in his career, and he scored runs at about the same rate as Rice even though he hit 100 fewer home runs one his career.

I can’t comment on the new movies – the prequels – as they are MA rated, and so not allowed in the Fibro. But the old movies – the ones you might remember watching the first time around (although you’ll never remember enough to satisfy the thirst for knowledge of the New Geek, who looks at you in incomprehension when you explain that it’s been 30 years since you watched Star Wars and you’re weren’t that impressed in the first place) – they all seem to have the same soundtrack.
And so we began at the scene of battle. A number of kobold corpses lay scattered about the ruined well house. One of the kobolds was still gasping for air, and makes the mistake of trying to mock the heroes for their fruitless search for Ronnick, the villain of the story. The kobold spits out a mouthful of blood and broken teeth before giggling maniacally and shouting “Ha, you took the bait! Now Ronnick can make it to his real hide out at Dragontooth Hill.” After a pause, the kobold realizes he gave away important information, but it is too late. He is tied up, interrogated, and finally, a magic missile by Faverel puts an end to his torment. As the kobold perishes with a smoking hole in his forehead, he shrugs and has one last gem of wisdom to offer. “Oh well, I had it coming.”
This week I’ve been listening to my Trevor Morgan CD “The Blessed and the Broken” in my car in preparation for the Third Day concert in May, because Trevor is opening for Third Day. It was actually at Fish Fest last summer that I first heard him when he played just a few songs at the beginning of Third Day’s set.
But the more I thought about it, the less the story hung together:
Wherefore, enter ye all into the joy of your Lord; Receive your reward, both the first, and likewise the second. You rich and poor together, hold high festival! You sober and you heedless, honour the day! Rejoice today, both you who have fasted and you who have disregarded the fast. The table is full-laden; feast ye all sumptuously. The calf is fatted; let no one go hungry away. Enjoy ye all the feast of faith: receive ye all the riches of loving-kindness.

This lasted for a few moments before she came back to her senses. She then pulled her coat around her and stood to leave. The pigeon hopped politely to one side. She hadn't even noticed me. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, people rarely do. My teeth ground together as I felt the anger rising in me. I watched her leave, and made a split second decision to head after her. I hung back a bit, I didn't want her to notice me now. Not yet anyway.
I took it. Obviously.
Me, being the beer geek I am, always show near opening, so thankfully they had everything still available. Sadly anyone arriving at, well lets say a normal beer drinking hour (maybe you had lunch first and arrived at say 2pm), arrived to empty taps and long arse lines.

I hope they refunded people.

For example, back in early February, Jason and I attended a country music concert put on by Miranda Lambert and Brad Paisley. I am not the country music fan in the family, so it was a bit of a unique experience for me. But we are over a month past the concert, so I feel like it would be wrong to blog about it now! So, instead, I will give you these "gems" that I felt it was necessary for my readers to know. (If they don't make sense to you, that's okay. I probably don't remember what was meant by them, either.)
Well, what can I say really? I’m a male trapped in a female’s body and it’s slowly destroying me.

Although I prefer the form of the English sonnet (I missed the final couplet), this might be my favourite poem I’ve composed this week. Perhaps it is just my getting used to metre – I found it easier to slip into iambic feet than in my English sonnet. As you can see, I drew up a rhyming bank from which to draw upon before starting the poem.

When my children are very young, they are not always able to understand and consider my needs. The friendships may look lopsided, just as some of my adult friendships do when one of us is going through difficult times. But I trust that if my children grow up being treated like my friends, they will know how to be friends. I look forward to great friendships with both of them. A war involves hostages. In some parent-child relationships, the child is almost like a hostage. But friendship does not involve hostages.

Dad said nothing. He put the tree to the side of the house and went off again to find another one. This went ahead every year. Dad would find a tree and bring it back for Mom’s approval. It usually took three or four attempts before Mom decided she liked the first one best. Dad would then strip some boughs from the others before putting them on the wood pile. He bored holes in the trunk of the Christmas tree and inserted the extra boughs to fill it out.

Planning to hit the studio in early June to lay down tracks for their third album, WOE’s reworked “Quietly, Undramatically” opens a new door on the title track from the band’s popular 2010 release of the same name. Vocalist/guitarist Chris Grigg notes, “the remixed version of ‘Quietly, Undramatically’ is a more accurate representation of what was hoped to achieve with the material and offers a different perspective into the album.” Decibel Magazine said, “Woe strive for sophistication without falling into the usual pitfalls of pretentiousness, cartoonish-ness or undue gloss. Essential aggression is maintained, while the atmospheric and emotional depth envelopes are pushed with a bold fearlessness.”
As with most right wing thinking, austerity is born from a lack of thought. It is a simple fact that cutting services means fewer jobs and raising taxes means people are worse off. The more unemployed you have the greater the drain on the economy, as the Government has to pay benefits but receive no taxes. The unemployment benefit is so laughable that people on it can’t usually spend anything outside of the basics, and so the economy loses out on sales, and the government loses out on VAT. Next, because the media constantly tells us we are in recession again, those people with jobs save their money. When they don’t spend, the shops lose out and in the worst cases have to enter insolvency, thus throwing another group of people out into unemployment. Cut, paste, repeat.

Following the guided tour we ended up back outside, in the shade under the roof of the “cafeteria” where the men share meals, prayer and reading from the Bible. Our conversation here lasted for some time and was very enjoyable and humbling.
I like to listen to Dave Ramsey. I find him to be very encouraging, not only about money, but about life in general. I’d also like to change my view, my family history of money. I don’t want to think of myself as poor. Just because my parents were in debt, and their parents before them, even if they weren’t in debt, were at least very poor, doesn’t have to mean that I can’t be successful financially in my life.
Counsel for the US Government went very close to arguing that TV Links was wrongly decided. In any event, Counsel sought to distinguish Mr O'Dwyer's behaviour from the restrictive decision in TVLinks. First the TVShack websites were entirely in the hands of Richard O’Dwyer and his co-conspirators, requiring third parties to sign up to TVShack and be vetted before going further. Secondly, unlike TVLinks, there was no attempt to protect copyright, as Mr O'Dwyer knew materials were subject to copyright and actively taunted already-cited efforts in June 2010 to seize TVShack.net.

2) Produce Truck! A few days ago, I saw a produce truck in my neighborhood. I’ve never seen before, although they’re catching on in cities across the country. I read an article about one in Detroit a few years back, and thought it was a great idea. Basically, vendors sell produce out of the back of a truck (like ice cream), driving around neighborhoods where residents don’t have easy access to fresh, healthy food, usually due of a lack of grocery stores. My neighborhood isn’t lacking in supermarkets (there are three within walking distance of my place, and two of them have low produce prices), but it’s a concept that I think is wonderful, so when I saw the truck a few days ago, I decided to stop and buy something from it the next time I saw it.
That’s usually where the conversation ends.

The BNP National Accounts manager, David Hannam, was not available for comment.
The trend that "Shutter Island" seems to be chasing is what I now call the Big Twist Narrative that seems to have plagued horror films and thrillers for the last ten years. The narratives often function as a series of twists, fakeouts and gotcha moments building to an ending designed to make you slap your head and proclaim "Holy crap! I didn't see that coming!" Who knew Rod Serling would become one of the most influential writers of our time? Most would obviously point to M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" as the Ground Zero moment when filmmakers started making movies that resembled feature-length Twilight Zone episodes. I do believe that is a bit unfair, as I still consider both the Twist in "Sense" and the story that precedes it to still be justified as a narrative about human emotions. Besides, the emotional climax of that movie was always the final scene between main character Cole Sear and his mother in the car.
Stan might also be making the connection that his mafia friends are not so friendly after all. This season has been better so far with the exception of us following the politician, which is a bit boring. I’m assuming he must still be connected in some way, perhaps his rival will be linked to it all, and he will be involved in uncovering it, thus redeeming his professional reputation.
I believe that the goal should change from making children happy and protecting them from harm to raising them to be independent adults able to problem-solve and cope in the real and sometimes difficult adult world. A safety net can become a trap. Dependence on one’s parents means lack of real security and often results in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It's nonsense. Someone has written another book about how kids these days never grow up, and how it's all the parents' fault for being too helpful, too involved, too available. Read more about it here. Apparently, parents need to set more boundaries, have higher expectations, force independence at a younger age. The goal of parenting should be independence instead of happiness?! Dependence leads to low self-esteem?! Security makes us feel insecure?! I disagree.

Strangely deleted and never reissued, this was the band reaching their peak when it came to recording an album. The early singles were superior work, and I always found the first two albums a tad fiddly and unnecessary in places. The importance of a good producer is also evident when comparing the Y Records release with this, the Arista (RCA distributed at the time) release. Paul Groucho Smykle has coated everything in a smooth adhesive-like production which bonds ten very different tracks into a highly cohesive and enjoyable listen. It is funky in all the right places, soft and gentle in others, the lyrics as always mean little with Carl Marsh and Barry Andrews sharing the vocal roles with great effect.

We all had so much fun working on our very pink dress up inspiration shoot. It was (for me) the first time working with children in multiples, which could have ended up going in any direction really.

Direct taxation has been reduced for the super-rich, and there has been a rise in the general tax allowance. Isn't allowance an interesting word? Yes, the Establishment have decided that we are 'allowed' to keep a little more of our own money; brazenly stating that they have control over our money! This rise in the untaxed 'allowance' is immediately wiped out by a massive rise in the cost of petrol and diesel. In the topsy-turvy UK, there are no measures to discourage employers employing people not living locally, so commuting is a fact of life for most people. The increase in fuel 'duty' (again, an interesting word!) simply transfers the money not stolen by direct taxation, to theft by indirect taxation. Considering the cost of fuel, the result of the two measures is to rob the people of more of our money, whilst appearing to take less. To emphasise this theft, fuel duty increases this week, but the tax allowance does not rise for a full twelve months.

On the lighter side of things, apparently you and I are working hard right now to help re-elect President Barack Obama, donating millions through taxes to his campaign to help transport security vehicles, armored limousines, and communications gear into cities ahead of his various campaign appearances. President Obama has decided to fly around the nation giving speech after speech instead of working hard to rebuild our economy, right-size government, lower the deficit, bring efficiency to operations, root out waste and fraud, and working to strike the compromises and deals needed to reform our bankrupt entitlement programs- and you're gonna pay for it.
My initial impression is that the flavor is a bit thin for what seems to be trying for a rich heaviness. It just seems like there ought to be more going on here.

So in conclusion, my “denomination” is everything aligned with the Word. I don’t need a fancy name or a huge building with the letters nailed across it. I am a Christian who believes that Jesus is my Lord and Savior, who died on the cross, resurrected, and is coming again (1 John 4:14, John 3:16, Matthew 18:7, Matthew 16:27). In simple terms, I reject anything that is not instructed and supported by God and His Word. We are the Church and the Holy Spirit dwells within us, what other definitions do we need?

He is the best eater EVER. He's a dream child at meal times. Whatever you give him he happily devours. And if there is something sweet, like cake, he says "no tanks" and normally ask for an orange or some kind of fruit instead. Yesterday we attended a birthday party and he didn't want cake or icecream. He just ate the fruit instead. Wow! He does eat some sweets, but for the most part, he doesn't prefer them. He loves to eat salads, most veggies (raw or cooked), fish, chicken, beef, peanut butter sandwiches, yogurt, waffles, anything! He's not a big fan of pasta, rice and carb-like dishes. And he would still prefer meals more plain (grilled chicken, green beans and a roll), rather than everything combined into a casserole. Of course, this is polar opposite of Holden, my pickier eater. Some of Pax's very favorite foods are: watermelon, apples, oranges, fresh veggies with hummus, waffles with maple syrup and my homemade granola, which he calls "gro-gro-grola". As many of you parents know, meal time with young kiddos can be a beating. Well, not true for Pax. I hope it sticks and he always loves the healthy stuff like he does right now.
At 180 pages long the book has enough space to cover quite a wide range of topics and it does so. Starting with a background to the team, moving on to the cars technology, to overviews of its design and operation. With its familiar graphical style and hardback format it certainly gives the feel of a proper workshop manual. However this is somewhat skin deep and the pages within, soon revert to a more typical book on F1, although some flashes of the Haynes style do remain.
So, therefore, I'm going to have to post about something entirely different. We're moving inside again after having missed out on an auction for 19 faux bamboo chairs kind of like this...

Before the 1830s, trains had not yet spread widely across the English country side and many factories still relied on canals for the transport of raw materials and goods to market. The postal system and its need to carry mail and people along particular routes required reform and refurbishment of the infrastructure during the late Regency period. Thomas Telford and John McAdam (of the Tar-McAdam or tarmac fame despite his not using tar in his construction, but possibly because of family business in the 18th century involving tar and shipbuilding) led to widespread renovations and improvements (in terms of the roads taking people where they wanted to go) on the Roman roads, including the Great North Road, the corridor between London and Edinburgh that is now called the A1.

“Our pools are more crammed to the gills than the unit 4 pool at Fukushima Daiichi, much more so,” noted Kamps of Beyond Nuclear. “It’s kind of like a very thick forest that’s waiting for a wildfire. It would take extraordinary measures to prevent nuclear chain reactions in our pools because the waste is so closely packed in there.”

And when Stuckey talks about whether “the city steps up,” he’s certainly not endorsing an open bidding process or ULURP, either of which might have delivered a project that gained more public support and delivered affordable housing earlier.
Wow! That is a pretty big challenge. There is a reason it is called “the shadow”. It can be a bit scary to take an honest look at what we are feeling and why. Isn’t it easier to sit in judgment and blame someone else than to take 100% responsibility for our own thoughts and actions? Ya, I think so too! But I have realized in recent days, months, years that I need to take 100% accountability for everything that happened or continues to happen in my life. Whether it’s the abuse I endured as a child, the issues in my marriage, or what I perceive to be happening within the roller derby league I was practicing with. This book reiterates what I already believe and that is that “thoughts are things” and we create our own world based on our thoughts. When I think, “Well they don’t like me and are ignoring me and leaving me out because they don’t like me” then it sets that “wish” into motion and sure enough I get more of what I perceived to be true. This just shows me that I am feeling separate from others….separate from my self…separate from God/Love. Where there is separation, there is fear. Where there is fear, there is the shadow. Where there is shadow, there is dis-ease, pain, sadness.
Well, what can I say really? I’m a male trapped in a female’s body and it’s slowly destroying me. I made this blog to share and vent my feelings in my usual rambling kind of way because away from my desk, I’m trapped in a stereotype of liking pink and trowelling make-up on my face. A dark, frightening world indeed.
I just love all the covers of this series. They are symbolic and yet simple. There's not too much that crowds the cover which is basically how I like them. I've read this series and I've fallen in love and learned to appreciate Lisa's style of writing.
According to The Bookseller today and of course, the Completely Novel website, Every Day I Lie A Little (what you are currently reading) made the short-list of author blogs. There are some really great blogs and twitter streams in the short list of 28, including Neil Gaiman, Fiona Robyn and Caroline Smailes. I'll be using the short and long-lists to discover new blogs to read.
“I love deviled eggs and they are so versatile, making a great snack, breakfast, lunch, hors d’oeuvres Take a hard boiled egg, rolling it to get the shell off without butchering the white part, slicing in half, taking out the yolk and mixing it with mayonnaise, mustard, and salt and pepper.

#738 - Tabu, A Story of the South Seas (1931) - (#228 on TSPDT) This Muranu film (co-directed of sorts with Robert Flaherty), the director's final film, released just after his death, is the highest ranked film in this update, and for the most part (excepting the two Renoir and Flaherty's own Louisiana Story) deserves to be. A fascinating look at tribal culture and law in the form of a tragic romance. History tells us that Flaherty was not happy with Murnau's screenplay - calling it too westernized - but even with this dissent, the combination of the German auteur's directorial prowess and Flaherty's naturalistic filmmaking style, make for a surprisingly intriguing work of cinematic art. I suppose considering this is a film from these two men, I should not be all that surprised at its bravura standing.

Running errands with the missus can be a challenge for any man, but when those errands involve a trip to Michaels it's all good. Yesterday I found a cool tower for $4.99. I primed this bad boy last night and look forward to giving it a stone-like finish. It was hard to take a good photo as Master Cylinder kept pushing it around the table and trying to chew on it.
I believe that the goal should change from making children happy and protecting them from harm to raising them to be independent adults able to problem-solve and cope in the real and sometimes difficult adult world. A safety net can become a trap. Dependence on one’s parents means lack of real security and often results in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It's nonsense. Someone has written another book about how kids these days never grow up, and how it's all the parents' fault for being too helpful, too involved, too available. Read more about it here. Apparently, parents need to set more boundaries, have higher expectations, force independence at a younger age. The goal of parenting should be independence instead of happiness?! Dependence leads to low self-esteem?! Security makes us feel insecure?! I disagree.

This test will be of individual words and non-words. Pupils will be asked to show that they can offer the correct readings for the real words and plausible readings for the non-words ie pronouncing the letters and letter-combinations with the sounds that the children have been taught. So, for example a non-word with the 'ou' letters in the middle could be pronounced either as 'ou' in 'sound' or as 'ou' in 'wound' (as in 'hurt') (all southern English pronunciations). Whether they could pronounce it as the 'ou' in 'touch' is, I think, unlikely. We shall see whether 'rare' pronunciations will be allowed when the actual test comes out.

I chose the idea that it’s all about the baby steps to get there. Sometimes, you just have to do just one thing, even if it doesn’t seem like something big. Even the littlest thing or ten minutes at a time can bring you closer to your goals. That’s why I changed my goal of “Finish Something” to “Work on the mermaids painting for twenty minutes a week last week.” I guess I only hit ten minutes the last two weeks, but it was better than the nothing at all I was doing before.

I wonder, while I sip, who will miss me? Who will feel sorry they didn’t take me seriously last time. Some people, I regret to say, probably won’t. There are some hard and cynical people out there. But plenty more will shed tears, and stare incredulously at those who don’t care.
If the book had fulfilled the promise it showed in the beginning, I might have given it five stars, but it has several serious flaws. One, as I have pointed out above, is its didacticism verging on propaganda for an oppressive regime. Another is that there are some serious unexplained plot holes.

Somewhere in the middle there I gave up on this book, and didn’t write a word for almost a year. I thought I was done. It was just too hard, and I wasn’t cut out to be a writer. In fact, that was part of the logic in going to South America. I thought if walking down those streets again couldn’t rekindle the fire I first felt, nothing would. It was a gamble, but when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.

Over the course of the week, I did daily yoga in addition to the other parts of the program which the participants mostly did at home on our own, following the instructions of the leader. For a few days, we ate a completely raw, vegan diet. We took salt water baths and drank small amounts of senna tea nightly. I napped a lot. Later in the week, we juice fasted. We did an internal salt water bath. Twice, we participated in a sweat lodge at the Lake Claire land trust.

Moore says building strategic partnerships enables companies to work through challenging markets and fast-track overall success. “As a CEO, I see it as part of my job to be a super connector, networking with the technology and investment community without an expectation of reciprocation. Partnerships forged through time, trust, and mutual benefit–such as those Axcient has built with HP, Ingram-Micro, and a vast network of service providers and resellers–are the types of community relationships that bring about the greatest returns.”

Further, the lawyers from the lawyers movement, in the aftermath of their rule of law revolution, have recoiled. There is no mass drive in the lower judiciary to change the system so people have access to justice, just political intrigue in the higher echelons. Here and there, people will surface with small plans in good faith. But even the education of law does not allow the development of local doctrines or critical legal thought.

Are there other reasons why a listing may be exempt? Absolutely. Maybe an executive is making a job transfer or there is a pending divorce and the home owners just don’t want to draw attention to their situation by having a “For Sale” sign in their front yard. In other words, they want to sell their home but prefer to keep a low profile. It is much harder to sell a home that we can’t advertise but for those of us that are connected in the community, surrounding areas & have a large network – it is doable. Once again, all it takes is that “right” buyer and if as a home owner, you are not listed, that “right” buyer will find something else.

When I first saw the Cobra B.A.T. action figure in the store as a kid I thought it was the coolest GI Joe figure EVER - he had a robot hands and could swap it out with a back pack full of kick ass-weapons. MAximum firepower with no guns - awesome! I also thought it was just one guy - some sort of Cobra cybernetic super-soldier. Then I saw the cartoon and was so disappointed when it turned out that B.A.T.stood for Battle Android Trooper and there were THOUSANDS of the useless losers. What a gyp. I like my idea better.
Anyway, that's all for now - if all goes well I should be updating this fairly regularly with what's going on in my life. Hope you enjoy!

Through his many shenanigans, Mancini has always been there to defend him – like a good manager is supposed to do. But following the defeat at Arsenal, it seemed Balotelli’s biggest fan had finally given up on him. Mancini stated: “City cannot afford to play Balotelli anymore. He will sit out for the rest of the season.” With that, it looks increasingly likely that the game against Arsenal was his final appearance in a sky blue shirt.

As we were leaving the appointment we received an awesome, unexpected blessing. I had already climbed into the backseat of the car with Nora. William was about to get in when a woman parked next to us rolled down her window. “Excuse me,” she said, “I just wanted to let you know that we’ve been praying for you!” She had never met us, only recognized us from the blog, yet boldly decided to speak out. By doing so she completely made our day! We had permanent smiles etched on our faces at yet another example of just how many lives little Nora has touched.

The basic premise of all three movies is that corporal punishment is used to discipline female inmates in prison. The first movie begins with a prisoner (Dominika) rejecting the sexual advances of a guard (Kelly, who appears in all three movies). Kelly retaliates by reporting to the Sergeant of the Guard that she has been attack by the prisoner. Of course, such acts are not to be tolerated so Dominika is brought to the guard house where she is bent over a table, bound by her wrists and her skirt is raised. Her punishment begins with a leather strap but this doesn't last long. Next, her legs are bound to the table legs and her punishment continues with the cane. The caning is 24 strokes, by my count, and it lasts over 5 minutes in the movie. It is shown from several camera angles but one is partially obstructed by a cement wall or post.
Results were gleaned from observations of 1,670 women who worked during pregnancy, of which 68 (four per cent) were exposed to either welding fumes or metal dusts or fumes.

For example, back in early February, Jason and I attended a country music concert put on by Miranda Lambert and Brad Paisley. I am not the country music fan in the family, so it was a bit of a unique experience for me. But we are over a month past the concert, so I feel like it would be wrong to blog about it now! So, instead, I will give you these "gems" that I felt it was necessary for my readers to know. (If they don't make sense to you, that's okay. I probably don't remember what was meant by them, either.)

Everyday, I read quotations by many different people who in some way or another have inspired me or who's work has resonated within me. Words are such powerful weapons, quotations can alter my mindset, comfort me, make me re-asess... but either way it's the power of words which at an early age drew me to get pen to paper and begin writing, the idea that words can have such a profound effect on people on a deeper level and higher consciousness is astounding.
My thoughts were so far from that it's ridiculous. I was thinking of the families who lost loved ones and friends in the towers and in the wars. I thought of all the sacrifice and pain and humiliation the US has suffered.

I'm not a very "in the moment" person. My head is usually recreating the past into ever rolling reinvented versions of the future. On the "Meyers Brigg", if you are familiar with that personality type tool, I'm an extreme "N', iNtuitive, living in the world of possibilities and connections, and not at all Sensing, grounded in reality and concrete things. The only time I get peace from my mind is when I run. There is something about the simple awareness of lungs, heart and muscle connecting with air and ground. Noticing the adrenaline kicking in and lifting my old joints into fluidity. Feeling the sun prickle my skin as the sweat rises. (In California. In Scotland it was the biting, icy wind). It was training for this event last year that reignited my dormant running addiction, and I feel quite satisfied that I'm going into it this year feeling strong and trained.

It must be that time of year because I know a lot of people who are in need of a get well card...everything from the stomach bug to broken bones. So I decided to use the cheerful Oops-a-Daisy set to create a simple set of Get Well cards. I started by matching up the ink colors to the Jillibean Homemade 6 Bean Soup patterned paper. I stamped the flowers in Colorbox Yellow Citrus, Maroon, Rouge, and Prima Turquoise Stone. Then I cut out the flower with the coordinating Oops-a-Daisy die. I cut ovals with the Spellbinders oval set and airbrushed inside the die line with Copics. I stamped the stem and leaves with Colorbox Lime Pastel ink and then popped the daisy up on foam tape. I wanted to keep it really simple so I just layered onto a scalloped oval and added a little ribbon to finish them off.

On the afternoon of Monday, January 8, 1912, Mrs. Grace Johnson, the director of the Springfield Museum of Natural History and Miss Fannie Stebbins, the supervisor of natural science for the Springfield School Department, assembled a group of amateur bird watchers and organized the Springfield Bird Club. The purpose of the club was “to attract, conserve and study birds.” A century later, the Allen Bird Club, as it soon came to be known, is still carrying out this original purpose.

At The Celebration, I attended the panel entitled "Teaching Students to Become History Detectives," featuring speakers Sandhya Nankani and Elyse Luray kicked off the panel by describing in fascinating detail her experiences as one of the five hosts of the PBS' American History series History Detectives. Once a top appraiser at Christie's auction house, Elyse has spent her years on the show using objects ranging from canons to horse saddles as the jumping off point to make amazing discoveries about U.S. history. At one point, Elyse found a piece of Amelia Earhart's airplane. At another juncture, she helped find the S.S. Portland, a sunken ship in Alaska which was the first ship that found gold there!
Formal confirmation as to whether the action has been raised in England or Scotland is awaited.

Subject: Re: FROM THE U.S AMBASSADOR
The incident has raised concerns for the medical-marijuana community in California, particularly the Harborside Health Center, a regulated dispensary also based in Oakland, which also happens to be the largest in the World. Harborside has had various threats from the IRS over the last two years regarding its business conduct, documented in ‘Weed Wars’, a program broadcast on the Discovery Channel. Assessing the situation from afar it seems noticeable that the authorities chose to attack the university (instead of just a dispensary) – perhaps because of their free licence to spread information on private production of cannabis and profiteering as a business, rather than just selling and distributing the drug. To try and determine the objectives of the authorities and federal agents who organised the raid, their concern on this front seems more understandable; the desire to exercise their power and eliminate personal usage whilst discrediting the facts and existing information.
But it’s through Elizabeth’s eyes that we can get a semblance of how these events affect her and her siblings. Elizabeth was a bright, young girl. She studied with the best professors and was often ages ahead of everybody else when it came to education. At the beginning of her life she was a doted upon child, who received every pleasure that her mother and father could provide to her. But with the death of her mother, she was rendered a bastard, and her titles taken away. No only that, but she was no longer given the care that she deserved and at one point in her young life was forced to go without clothing. She was in exile. Following Henry’s marriage to Catherine Parr, he reinstated her into his will, as the third successor to the throne, following Edward VI and her older sister Mary. This was a happy time in her life, she was the apple of her father’s eye, being so much like him. Her position in life was stable and she had good relationships with her siblings. But everything changed with the death of her father, and her brother Edward VI’s succession to the throne. It should be noted that during this time the new religion has held strong. The story of this period of Elizabeth’s life became much of a struggle revolving around religion. Her brother was Protestant, her sister Catholic. Both of their reigns were blemished with religious competition and the will to bring their religion to the people. Mary’s reign was very difficult for Elizatbeth, not only due to their religious differences but also due to Elizabeth’s involvement in plots against Mary. But finally following a series of maladies disguised as pregnancies to Mary, she died and Elizabeth was given the throne. There starts the reign of Elizabeth, one of the longest-serving Queens/Kings ever. She became the virgin Queen, to never marry, she became one of England’s greatest rulers. Commanding both respect and fear.

For starters, no one is property, we are not owned by anyone. Second of all, women especially are not property. To me, that shows insecurity, and the fact that this kid said it the way he did, I think either he learned it from friends or his own dad. Plus, he crashed her car, she didn’t crash it, and yet he is telling her to ‘shut up’ which is the most uncalled for act he could have done besides referring to her as his ‘property.’ It wasn’t her fault, it was his, but the whole endeavor was just uncalled for

5. Road trip. I’ve been thinking about this one for quite some time. I don’t know how feasible this is, especially since I’ll be working full time, but I’d like to make some road trips east over a couple weekends or so. I’ve always been interested in experiencing the other parts of America (especially non-coastal states), because I feel there is a vast disconnect between coastal and non-coastal states. I would ideally get a lot of driving done on awesome roads, see lots of interesting sights, and learn new things. Not sure if I want to go it alone or bring along some friends. Friends are always fun, but I think solo trips bring in a completely different experience, which could be good for me as well. I guess we’ll see!

We see this in Hebrews 10:19-22, where we are encouraged to come near to God in “the house of God” through the torn “veil” of the broken “flesh”, and through the shed blood, which is “sprinkled” (cp. 9:21) on our hearts, of Christ the “High Priest”. It is impossible to exclude the Eucharist from our interpretation of this passage, especially since this entrance into “the Holiest” is said to be a “new and living way”, while the Eucharist, which also happens in the house of God, the Church, is called the “new covenant”.

It took a while for Greg, Robert and I to get into the dancing, although the drumming (provided by the amazing Bill Matthews and Friends) was highly infectious and could not be resisted for long. Greg and I were both moving to the rhythms, although not quite dancing during the early numbers. Robert was appreciative of the music but not moving too much early on. At some point during that first hour of music, one of the dancers, a lithe, lovely raven-haired vision in white lace, extended a graceful hand to me and drew me into the dance. From then on, for a total of around 3 hours, it was nearly non-stop dancing for me. Greg had started really dancing around this time too and never stopped.
I thought that Fever had a much faster pace than Wither. There is never a dull moment as Rhine flits from one danger to the next in her quest to reach her home in Manhattan and reunite with her twin brother Rowan. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and wasn’t sure what was worse living a lie as Linden’s wife? Or acting as Madams puppet in her Carnival? Both lifestyles are equally as shocking and horrendous and I love that about Lauren DeStefano’s books, how she doesn’t shy away from tough topics. Whereas in book one we got to look at life as a bride this book takes a look into life as a prostitute which was as equally harrowing yet fascinating to read about. Although controversial topics, I think they add an extra layer of horror to the books and because of that make this future in particular one of the bleakest and cruellest I’ve read in dystopian fiction.
If you’ve spent the day dodging showers and are currently sat at home with a cup of tea staring out of a rain soaked window then look away from this blog now…Because that’s what today is ALL about! In contrast to our weeks of no rain and dry grounds, we’ve consistently had rain pretty much for the past week now. But we’re still in a drought, of course. With today being quite hectic and involving a bit of flitting about all over the place, I took the opportunity to take my photos whilst sat in the car. That’s right! Lazy!
As a wee boy growing up in Edinburgh, I remember dressing up as Dracula on Halloween night. Besides preparing me with the requisite black hair and fangs, mum also handed me a turnip as I walked out the door. In Scotland it’s not “trick-or treating”, it’s “guising” and instead of carving pumpkins, we carve turnips. Every year my brothers and I would go out guising together. In this tradition when you arrive at each door, you first recite a poem, sing a song, do a magic trick, or perform some other form of entertainment to persuade an offering of a treat. If your performance wasn’t well-received, you might get nowt (nothing)! (In the high school years, retaliation for this rejection was sometimes given through an egging, which, of course, I never participated in.) While we walked the neighborhood, my brothers and I would carry our carved turnips, called turnip lanterns, to light the way.
The strawberries are sending out lots of leaves and blossoms. The Earliglow and Jewel types are showing some fruit set already. The Shuksan should set fruit in the next week. I’m curious how the wild strawberries do in terms of setting fruit. They have a LOT of flowers this year and are everywhere in the berms and paths. I think they are usually pretty shy about setting fruit. Maybe next year will be different once we have the bees…

What happens when an ‘extremist’ organisation is banned? Some - or even lots - of its member and supporters become angry and disaffected about the denial of their democratic right to be a member of a non-violent organisation. It the EDL case it is an organisation whose literature does not actually contain a single word that can justifiably be deemed as extreme. The EDL can only be deemed extreme if you look at it through the lense of Marxist theory in which any criticism of an 'oppressed group' is by definition both 'fascist' and 'racist'.
Last weekend I was challenged to think about what I’m passionate about. I attended a writer’s workshop in Denver to learn more about the possibility of publishing a book on conscious creation. During that seminar, I experienced an extreme range of emotion. First I was elated, filled with inspiration and creativity and dreams of the New York Times bestseller list in my mind. The next day, reality set in when I learned how difficult publishing can be, how rare it is to succeed in the industry and how much time needs to be devoted to not just writing a book but promoting it as well.

Net result? Most computer programmers are guys. Not because they’re naturally more talented at it, and not even (entirely) because there are sexist barriers to entry to that field, but because when this generation of girls was ten years old, they were told by the media that tech is a boys’ world, and that the world to which they should aspire centers around housekeeping, looking pretty and breeding. Even if no one else in her life told her she couldn’t be a programmer, she’s unlikely to pursue that career because not enough people told her she could.

I founded Naadyn (old bandname Tape3000) in 2007. All songs are written and produced by myself. I started to learn some programs and composed melodies with a synthesizer (Microkorg). Over the years my music changed and I finally found what my sound should be like. I still record melodies, work a lot to find the right arrangement and add my voice. But the way how I produce my songs is basically the same: Sitting in my room, dim light, a computer and a synthesizer, some chocolate, three cats and a night that becomes a day.

I believe that the goal should change from making children happy and protecting them from harm to raising them to be independent adults able to problem-solve and cope in the real and sometimes difficult adult world. A safety net can become a trap. Dependence on one’s parents means lack of real security and often results in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It's nonsense. Someone has written another book about how kids these days never grow up, and how it's all the parents' fault for being too helpful, too involved, too available. Read more about it here. Apparently, parents need to set more boundaries, have higher expectations, force independence at a younger age. The goal of parenting should be independence instead of happiness?! Dependence leads to low self-esteem?! Security makes us feel insecure?! I disagree.

You’re not yet bombarded with paying bills or having a steady job – you can enjoy each other – you can focus on your feelings and not much else.

This book reminds you of what’s important at any stage in relationships – focusing on what you appreciate about the person, not what annoys you.
Driven shows all the hallmarks of Sallis’ succint prose and spot on pacing. However, the ambiguous plot points wore thin after awhile.

Maybe I was searching for easy reading, a paint by numbers. (I read this after running a half-marathon.

Planning to hit the studio in early June to lay down tracks for their third album, WOE’s reworked “Quietly, Undramatically” opens a new door on the title track from the band’s popular 2010 release of the same name. Vocalist/guitarist Chris Grigg notes, “the remixed version of ‘Quietly, Undramatically’ is a more accurate representation of what was hoped to achieve with the material and offers a different perspective into the album.” Decibel Magazine said, “Woe strive for sophistication without falling into the usual pitfalls of pretentiousness, cartoonish-ness or undue gloss. Essential aggression is maintained, while the atmospheric and emotional depth envelopes are pushed with a bold fearlessness.”

I had never heard of the designation CODA (Child of Deaf Adult) until after I moved away from home and saw the Hallmark movie “Love is Never Silent.” In the movie, there’s a confrontational scene between the deaf parents and the hearing daughter after she’s moved away from home. During that scene, I broke down and sobbed like I’d never cried in all my life. In fact, I couldn’t even talk about that movie for a couple of years without starting to cry. I wasn’t angry with my parents. Nor do I think I had an unlucky childhood. That movie began a process which helped me learn how important it is that I embrace who I am. I am in both worlds, both deaf and hearing. My personality is different in each world. When I sign to deaf people I’m no longer shy. If I see a deaf person signing, I want to go over and introduce myself. In the hearing world, I’m much more reserved. Since then, I’ve learned to recognize that I can live in both worlds at the same time.

A few hours after I watched “Mirror Mirror” someone asked me what I thought of it and my response was “Snow White was a little hottie!”, and I must admit I was quite taken with newcomer Lily Collins. Collins is very charismatic and gives a nice performance as Snow White. She’s sweet and lovable and you can understand why the Prince falls for her and the Queen loathes her. Even one of the dwarfs quickly develops a strong attraction to her (the other dwarfs obviously love her, too, but not in the same way). Collins, the daughter of Genesis drummer and vocalist Phil Collins, shines bright in the movie and will no doubt be a star to watch over the next few years.

When her parents are murdered before her eyes, sixteen-year-old Helen Cartwright finds herself launched into an underground London where a mysterious organization called the Dictata controls the balance of good and evil. Helen learns that she is one of three remaining angelic descendants charged with protecting the world's past, present, and future. Unbeknownst to her, she has been trained her whole life to accept this responsibility. Now, as she finds herself torn between the angelic brothers protecting her and the devastatingly handsome childhood friend who wants to destroy her, she must prepare to be brave, to be hunted, and above all to be strong, because temptation will be hard to resist, even for an angel.

I sent her the card along with a great little insulated lunch bag! I found the bag at Stein-mart around Christmas and immediately thought about my Sis (oh did I mention, she's MUCH older than me!!).

I say ‘my’. In fact, I suspect this is something we’ve all had to begrudgingly figure out at some point or other, regardless of the bullshit behind it being lower-cased or title-cased. I suppose it’s just that, with the big-B’d Bullshit, finding yourself ribbon-tangled in a number of hugely conflicting emotions at any one time is less an occasional nuisance of a lesson learned than a baffling mindfuck of a rammed-down-your-throat crash-course exam-retake in genetics from a Klingon-speaking Amy Childs.
IN Canada, Chinese clients at a bank may receive assistance from an officer who speaks either Guang dong hua (Cantonese) or Guo yu (Mandarin). An American company, Rosetta Stone, marketing a computerised language program runs a TV ad that has a Caucasian at the end saying: “Xian zai wo wei shuo Guo yu” (“Now I can speak Mandarin”).

For most 9 year olds, forgoing birthday gifts for donations to a food bank would result in a tantrum. For Noah, however, it was just the right thing to do.
An important ( if logical) thing to remember is that if your php code is dodgy it will produce dodgy HTML, which means your site won’t be written in valid code. Working out what is going wrong however is a multi-step process for me, a mere server-less mortal with a laptop: change code on my machine, upload to browser, view on browser, swear a couple of times, change code on my machine, upload…well, you get the gist of it.

I recognize the garter and the button hook, and I know that is a bolt but even Dad didn't know what it was for. And that brass thing winds so that the shaft with the point is hidden in the tube.

Hola from Peru! We are the May Peru trip leaders Jess and Holly. We have had an incredible first few days and are excited to have started placements. We have had the wonderful opportunity of being able to watch the participants experience new relationships, new opportunities, and immerse themselves in the Peruvian culture. This week we are working on the construction of a daycare in Pacifico de Villa, as well as assisting at Laura Alva Saldana; a school for children with exceptionalities, and teaching English to children at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey schools. I (Jess) have been working at Laura Alva Saldana with four participants, where I would assist them with communicating with the teachers and students. While I (Holly) have been working at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey, assisting participants as they teach children English at the primary and secondary level. We would like to turn it over to a few of our participants, as they will be sharing some of their experiences this week. We encourage you to follow along with us on our amazing journey.

Relationships: Whoever you are, you need a support system. Relationships are vital to your health. You need to lovingly weed those negative people out of your garden. Negativity is toxic. If you are eating raw organic vegan and jogging ten miles, and then going home and being verbally abused, your health is still going to suffer. Everyone has a responsibility to take care of her own garden. Bless those negative people and love yourself enough to extract yourself from that situation. If you need help, get it.
This isn't to punish us. Everything in life is showing us our connection to every other thing - the wheels are set in motion for all of us. We can barricade that door and spend weeks, months, maybe even years holding at bay what we think is out there - but it is absolutely coming in anyway - or we can open that door now.
When I remember back on things that make me feel guilty I tend to remember them as if I’m looking at myself from outside my body. It's a false sense of memory, perhaps a way to deal with the guilt. There are many things I don’t remember at all. My brother is good at telling me things I said years ago that I can't remember in any shape or form. Maybe I don't remember those because they didn’t make me feel guilty.
Hi Folks! I’m a pacifist at heart and I have no desire to see guns in the school. But I also have no desire to see a boy told he cannot wear the hat he decorated with toy soldiers because the soldiers are carrying — guess what? Toy guns.
I'm not a very "in the moment" person. My head is usually recreating the past into ever rolling reinvented versions of the future. On the "Meyers Brigg", if you are familiar with that personality type tool, I'm an extreme "N', iNtuitive, living in the world of possibilities and connections, and not at all Sensing, grounded in reality and concrete things. The only time I get peace from my mind is when I run. There is something about the simple awareness of lungs, heart and muscle connecting with air and ground. Noticing the adrenaline kicking in and lifting my old joints into fluidity. Feeling the sun prickle my skin as the sweat rises. (In California. In Scotland it was the biting, icy wind). It was training for this event last year that reignited my dormant running addiction, and I feel quite satisfied that I'm going into it this year feeling strong and trained.

In contrast, to address these challenges the SNP Government have focused upon reinvigorating our economy by investing in infrastructure projects such as building new homes, roads, hospitals and investments such as the new Airdrie Health Centre.

Wow! That is a pretty big challenge. There is a reason it is called “the shadow”. It can be a bit scary to take an honest look at what we are feeling and why. Isn’t it easier to sit in judgment and blame someone else than to take 100% responsibility for our own thoughts and actions? Ya, I think so too! But I have realized in recent days, months, years that I need to take 100% accountability for everything that happened or continues to happen in my life. Whether it’s the abuse I endured as a child, the issues in my marriage, or what I perceive to be happening within the roller derby league I was practicing with. This book reiterates what I already believe and that is that “thoughts are things” and we create our own world based on our thoughts. When I think, “Well they don’t like me and are ignoring me and leaving me out because they don’t like me” then it sets that “wish” into motion and sure enough I get more of what I perceived to be true. This just shows me that I am feeling separate from others….separate from my self…separate from God/Love. Where there is separation, there is fear. Where there is fear, there is the shadow. Where there is shadow, there is dis-ease, pain, sadness.

My wife and I are one of many same-sex couples who lived under a strange compromise. I'll try to recap succinctly. We married in Massachusetts on December 31, 2004. Our marriage was legally invalidated by judges because we were not residents of Massachusetts, and there was a law against letting out-of-state couples marry there if their marriage would be illegal in their home state. (The original intent of the law was to prevent interracial couples from traveling out-of-state to marry in Massachusetts, which demonstrates how intertwined all sorts of oppression are.) Then that law was overturned, and around the same time, the State of New York began to honor marriages that had been contracted *out* of state. As in, one couldn't legally marry a same-sex partner in New York, but could marry out of state. L'Ailee and I went back to Massachusetts as close as we could to our anniversary and re-married.
“Where are you from?” I asked. He told me he was from Turkey and what his academic interests were. He then asked me where I was from and where I went to school. I responded that I was born and raised in Norfolk, and that I went to the university in my backyard for my bachelor’s and master’s. He repeated what I said for clarification; I confirmed it; and his response was, “That’s strange.”

Born Virginia Hensley and referred to by her family as “Ginny”, Patsy Cline displayed a talent for performing as early as the age of 4, when she won first prize in an amateur tap-dancing contest. It was not long afterward that she transferred her enthusiasm from dance to music, and for her eighth birthday Ginny’s mother bought a piano to provide her with a means to develop her natural musical skills. By her early teens she was singing in the choir of the family’s Baptist church and on her own at the local radio station. At the age of 13 the young girl’s life was nearly brought to end by an attack of rheumatic fever, which forced her to spend a period in an oxygen tent; she would later attribute the quality of her voice to the throat infection that resulted from her illness. Two years later her father abandoned the family and Ginny was forced to drop out of school, taking night jobs singing at clubs in addition to service jobs during the day in order to help pay the bills.

Endings. Again, like The House of the Devil - which I'm constantly comparing to as it's such an awesome movie - The Innkeepers somewhat challenges its audience. Did it really happen? I know of people who read the ending of The House of the Devil as a possible “dream state/imaginary” space as to say that the movie never really happened… strange yes, and I do not really agree with it either, but at the same time, I definitely feel that The Innkeepers does pose similar questions. Did it really happen or was it in the state of fear and confusion that brought it all on? The last shot lingers on for an eternity before presenting the answer. And I also find that last scene to be part of the intelligent narrative that West uses in The Innkeepers. It's not to unlike the viral video that was seen earlier. He builds to a climax with the exact same tricks that the viral video does. And this is a motif that I find runs vibrantly though the movie. Is it real or all just a trick? During the last half hour, I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a scene where Claire wakes up and it all had been a dream. Now this doesn’t happen obviously, but in some strange way there’s a feeling that it could have happened in the last act.

Another night as I walked home from the subway the long-setted sun had left the sky dark, but some high-flying clouds in the eastern sky were still burning faintly with an orange glow. The sun’s light had refracted around our world and illuminated the floating vapour in an illusive light. I realized that the description of why it was happening was less beautiful than the fact that it was. So I stopped and looked up at the cool-orange glow and thought about nothing.
You can tell almost immediately that Harber (who also penned the Eddie Romero-directed flick The Kidnappers and an episode of "Hawaii 5-0") had a copy of "Island Of Lost Souls" sitting by his typewriter as he knocked out this script. After all, when you have an island, an evil and/or mad scientist, experiments shrouded in secrecy and an unseen monster, there's every indication that you're not watching an original work. Yes, this is a story that has been done time and again, and would be done even more times than here (shall we flash-forward to 1977 and 1996, anyone? No? Wise choice.) and this isn't even the worst example of this retelling. At least they do us the honor of not giving us a title like H.G. Wells' Terror Is A Man or a subtitle like Terror Is A Man: Island Of Lost Souls. Points for integrity, guys.

So what is it that gives me this reaction? Well, I'll tell you now, it's not just characters with a low level of intelligence.

At one point I even asked myself in adversarial fashion, "What, Juliette, are you really looking for characters who are exactly at your level of intelligence and can't make mistakes?"

Before the 1830s, trains had not yet spread widely across the English country side and many factories still relied on canals for the transport of raw materials and goods to market. The postal system and its need to carry mail and people along particular routes required reform and refurbishment of the infrastructure during the late Regency period. Thomas Telford and John McAdam (of the Tar-McAdam or tarmac fame despite his not using tar in his construction, but possibly because of family business in the 18th century involving tar and shipbuilding) led to widespread renovations and improvements (in terms of the roads taking people where they wanted to go) on the Roman roads, including the Great North Road, the corridor between London and Edinburgh that is now called the A1.

For years my father dealt with bouts of constipation stemming from what he self diagnosed as a “bad stomach.” In his youth, he had very poor nutrition, as his family lived in abject poverty. Upon his 12th birthday, he left to work on the cargo ships where he ate whatever was canned and salted amidst dank conditions and constant stress. In his early twenties, he came to the U.S. and ate one meal a day while working 12 hour shifts at a restaurant. He worked like an animal going from dishwasher, to busboy, to food runner, to line cook and finally, head cook of a high end Greek eatery. Then he bought his own restaurant along with two other friends. The workload should have been divided by three, but my dad ended up working 24 hours shifts. He lived on black coffee and inhaled meals on the go. When he got married to my mom, issues with his partners ended up forcing him to carry the restaurant himself. He had to be everywhere at one time. He was always under slept, stressed and constipated. When he did poop, it would be very hard to pass or would come out in ribbon like pieces. He dropped to 125 lbs. He looked scary. Solution: my parents sold the business and moved to Greece. He ate well. He basked in the sun. He gained weight and pooped like clockwork. Everything was great, except for one detail. Island life in Greece circa 1980 was something my mother could not handle with two babies. There was only one phone in each village, no indoor plumbing and limited access to the things needed to take care of us. She wanted to go back. My father listened. In the years that followed, my father worked from scratch again, since the restaurant was sold before we moved. He learned he had an ulcer in his stomach. He had kidney stones. He was constipated. He put himself on special “diets” to cleanse his bowels and calm his sour stomach. He was angry and stressed all the time. Life was not pleasant. Then he retired from all work when he turned 50. Despite the lack of work related stress, he was still angry and preoccupied. The patterns of constipation continued throughout the rest of the 90's and in the first decade of 2000's. This past December, after experiencing some intense pain on his left side and being unable to eat, he went for his first colonoscopy. It indicated adenocarcinoma, the cancer that typically occurs in the colon. Thankfully, it was still in stage 2 and operable. He is now doing chemo, eating super well, and gaining back weight and energy. The doctors feel optimistic that he beat it. My point of outlining his whole story is that had he paid attention to what his colon was telling him all along with the bouts of constipation and digestive issues, he would have changed his lifestyle and eating habits for the better. He is lucky. Had he refused, as many old school European types tend to do, to go for that colonoscopy, he probably would have been well into stage 4 before it was detected. It would have been too late.
Once you are done spraying carefully clean up your star dies with a little bit of hand sanitizer. This contains alcohol and will remove all the marker from the metal very easily.

I am reminded of James Howard Kunstler's admonition that during times of great stress mass delusions of deliverance--in this case through technology--are often afoot. I cannot fault fusion researchers for working on the intriguing problem of sustaining a fusion reaction that will produce more energy than it consumes. Nor can I fault them for seeking out the safest fuel possible. But the drumbeat in the media that alternatives are just around the corner--if we will only do things such as set up a Moon base and mine the surface--take the public's eye off more viable responses.
But this is what I did, and my bathroom was cleaner then than it is now that I have lots of time: I used that playing time (and you really only need five minutes) to get the toilet scrubbed, wiped down, and dried off. Then, since I've used the sink for my water supply, I clean that, using a different sponge, and rinse and dry it off. (Use rag towels for drying.) Wipe off the mirror.

Since being practically forced into doing a bold lip everyday for work, I've fallen in love with lipstick so much that I continue to do bold lip looks on my days off! I could very easily go months without doing a bold eyeshadow look, but then my blog would be reallllly boring. Thankfully I have quite a few dramatic eye looks backlogged that I can post :)
On the paths through the gardens we sheet mulched, which means we covered the ground with cardboard and then covered that with wood chips to prevent weeds and grass from growing. This is a great way to keep weeds out of your garden. If you garden, you know weeds can quickly spread from a weedy to a non-weedy area, so if we completely weed out an entire yard or garden, it will be way more difficult for the weeds to get into your garden beds. It also just looks better to have clearly visible, neat and weedless paths going through your beds. It was a lot of work weeding out all that grass and shoveling all those wood chips…but it will be so worth it down the road when we don’t have to weed so often! Plus it’s a great workout. We joke at the garden that if you garden you don’t need to buy a gym membership. And it’s a great way to work on your tan.
In candolim, I cycled first to the apartments, where mum would arrive later in the evening, where I would come eventually to surprise her, and left a little birthday note (it was her birthday) and then headed for the beach. I could feel my brain boiling in its fluid by the time I found a way to the beach. But I still had to drag my cycle across the sand, now that we’d come this far, it had to see the sea as well. It is hard work dragging a cycle in the sand but I got it there and headed for one of the shacks. Putting the stand on one of my chappals in the shade, I stood staring at the sea, taking it all in, for a long moment before finally settling down into a chair and ordering a large lunch. I’d left home with a little less than 500 bucks, and now, four days later (and much thanks to Suji) I had about
There is also a photograph of a man standing at a press table in the middle of an empty arena, his hand covering his face in expressionistic gesture. This man seems like discoursing minister, full of pomp and rhetoric, and what occurs here is quite interesting. Does Pfeiffer suggest that signifiers of video and spectacle inducing media cover up feelings in society that seem to be much like old fashion worship? Are basketball players and media figures our temporary gods, replaced each night by new symbols? There is pessimism at work here.

The incident has raised concerns for the medical-marijuana community in California, particularly the Harborside Health Center, a regulated dispensary also based in Oakland, which also happens to be the largest in the World. Harborside has had various threats from the IRS over the last two years regarding its business conduct, documented in ‘Weed Wars’, a program broadcast on the Discovery Channel. Assessing the situation from afar it seems noticeable that the authorities chose to attack the university (instead of just a dispensary) – perhaps because of their free licence to spread information on private production of cannabis and profiteering as a business, rather than just selling and distributing the drug. To try and determine the objectives of the authorities and federal agents who organised the raid, their concern on this front seems more understandable; the desire to exercise their power and eliminate personal usage whilst discrediting the facts and existing information.

They moved the tent. My brother handed the ashes to the worker who stood in the hole. He placed the box inside a steel box in the ground. Then they asked if we had anything else to place in the box with her. We didn’t know we could do that. No one told us and I didn’t think to ask. I had never done this before. But nephew’s mom had the bouquet which she was pleased to put in the box. I put in a red rose as did my sister-in-law. That was it. We didn’t know what else to do.

It took them rather longer, looking back, than one might have expected, but they obviously thought very hard, particularly after the second summer, 2007, and said, "We're not going to get anywhere taking on the British soldiers at what they do best; ergo we will find another way".
One of the things I love about the human heart is that it’s wired to help others when they’re in need. I see this repeated over and over: when a natural disaster strikes a town, or when a terrible wrong is committed against someone who’s done right, or when a beloved friend passes away. When people see a need, they often respond with caring hearts.

I have one of those phone messages people complain about. I tell callers what number they have dialed and kindly ask them to leave a message if they are so inclined. My mother hates my message. She asks how people will know whom they’ve reached. I figure you either know me and will leave a message or you hope you know me, leave a message and take your chances. The last thing I want to do is give someone from whom I may not want to hear more information about me. I don’t want to validate telemarketers or let the robocallers know that they’ve reached a live one.
I had never heard of the designation CODA (Child of Deaf Adult) until after I moved away from home and saw the Hallmark movie “Love is Never Silent.” In the movie, there’s a confrontational scene between the deaf parents and the hearing daughter after she’s moved away from home. During that scene, I broke down and sobbed like I’d never cried in all my life. In fact, I couldn’t even talk about that movie for a couple of years without starting to cry. I wasn’t angry with my parents. Nor do I think I had an unlucky childhood. That movie began a process which helped me learn how important it is that I embrace who I am. I am in both worlds, both deaf and hearing. My personality is different in each world. When I sign to deaf people I’m no longer shy. If I see a deaf person signing, I want to go over and introduce myself. In the hearing world, I’m much more reserved. Since then, I’ve learned to recognize that I can live in both worlds at the same time.

Venus goes retrograde this month and in my experience, this brings about a value review. What we want and ask for is a reflection of our value and if you have been denying yourself something, pretending that you and your life are fine even if you don’t think that’s true, or not being clear on what you want in your life, this is going to bring light to that situation. The resolution lies in being honest with yourself, working on your value system, acknowledging yourself and having the courage to know you deserve the best, brightest, most wonderful outcome in every situation.
Everyday, I read quotations by many different people who in some way or another have inspired me or who's work has resonated within me. Words are such powerful weapons, quotations can alter my mindset, comfort me, make me re-asess... but either way it's the power of words which at an early age drew me to get pen to paper and begin writing, the idea that words can have such a profound effect on people on a deeper level and higher consciousness is astounding.

Surprise’s are fun sometimes, no? I was really happy that the fact that Naughty Dog has been working on The Last of Us for a good 18 months never got out there. I guess I can now say that when I intervewed there in spring 2010, the second team building was on it’s way I think. There’s so little surprises in the videogames industry as rumours are usually 99% of the time true. I think for many of us the first reaction was that man, this end of the world zombie stuff is played out and I feel that, but on the other hand, if Naughty Dog are going for real survival horror and building relationships between the key characters, that’s something that really hasn’t been done very well at all in the last few years.

He would win true acclaim and popularity, however, as the city's district attorney proper, serving first from 1853-1859 and again from 1861-1869, one of New York's most important legal voices during the Civil War. He allegedly prosecuted over 12,000 cases. He was also on hand during the Draft Riots, funneling many rioters through the court system and straight to jail. His accomplice was often judge John Hoffman, soon to be the mayor of New York who preceded Hall. Their crusades against rioters would boost both their popularity.

It must be that time of year because I know a lot of people who are in need of a get well card...everything from the stomach bug to broken bones. So I decided to use the cheerful Oops-a-Daisy set to create a simple set of Get Well cards. I started by matching up the ink colors to the Jillibean Homemade 6 Bean Soup patterned paper. I stamped the flowers in Colorbox Yellow Citrus, Maroon, Rouge, and Prima Turquoise Stone. Then I cut out the flower with the coordinating Oops-a-Daisy die. I cut ovals with the Spellbinders oval set and airbrushed inside the die line with Copics. I stamped the stem and leaves with Colorbox Lime Pastel ink and then popped the daisy up on foam tape. I wanted to keep it really simple so I just layered onto a scalloped oval and added a little ribbon to finish them off.
My wife and I are one of many same-sex couples who lived under a strange compromise. I'll try to recap succinctly. We married in Massachusetts on December 31, 2004. Our marriage was legally invalidated by judges because we were not residents of Massachusetts, and there was a law against letting out-of-state couples marry there if their marriage would be illegal in their home state. (The original intent of the law was to prevent interracial couples from traveling out-of-state to marry in Massachusetts, which demonstrates how intertwined all sorts of oppression are.) Then that law was overturned, and around the same time, the State of New York began to honor marriages that had been contracted *out* of state. As in, one couldn't legally marry a same-sex partner in New York, but could marry out of state. L'Ailee and I went back to Massachusetts as close as we could to our anniversary and re-married.
The dialogue delivery was a pain all through the movie. Dev Patel was an eye sore and the Bollywood style romance with Frieda Pinto seemed utterly out of place. Everything he did rang hollow: every piece of dialogue, every bit of action, everything. Let us be honest. Dev Patel would not last five minutes in a Mumbai slum. It all seemed fictitious and unbelievable to me.

13.) “Make It Out Alive” f/ Freddie Gibbs & Crooked I
A couple of weeks ago my writing took a bit of a blow; having had a spectacular start to the masters course with A+ grades and general good feelings about my work coming from most angles, I decided to take some risks with my subject matter and style. I thought I had stepped up my game, I felt my prose had taken on a poetic aspect and I was writing the strange, macabre tales I would love to read. But, without any prior notice, my grade dropped rather significantly. Perhaps the risks were a mistake, or perhaps the process of marking creative writing will always be a subjective practice no matter how greatly objectivity is pursued. Either way I didn’t take the criticism very well. I called my friends who met me immediately in the pub for five hours of Articulate (possibly the best board game ever) and copious amounts of cloudy cider. Hugging the toilet bowl the following morning, a promise I had made myself a few years ago not to turn to alcohol in times of rejection/massive self-pity resurfaced. A little too late maybe, but I reaffirmed it that day all the same.

For a spotlight on science, three new books from Prometheus Books will provide some interesting reading. They are The Genesis of Science: The Story of Greek Imagination by Stephen Bertman ($27.00) who notes that, while historians often look to ancient Greece as the wellspring of Western civilization, perhaps the most significant achievement, other than democracy, was the early development of the sciences. The names of many of science’s branches have their roots in Greek words that first defined these disciplines. This is an excellent history. Science in America was of widespread interest to many of the Founding Fathers and, along with Franklin, one of the greatest, most inquiring minds was that of Thomas Jefferson. In A Professor, a President and a Meteor: The Birth of American Science, Cathryn J. Prince tells the story of a meteor crash in 1807 sparked the interest of a young chemistry professor at Yale College. His rigorous investigation of the event started a chain of events that lifted American science to international importance, unfortunately pitting him against then President Jefferson who took issue with it. It’s a lively story worth reading. Lastly, there’s The Wonder of Genetics: The Creepy, the Curious, and the Commonplace by Richard V. Knowles ($25.00) that provides a layman’s introduction and explanation of genetics, discussing its importance and scope. The author is an acclaimed geneticist who devotes chapter after chapter of a genuinely fascinating topic, discussing topics as diverse as genetically modified crops, cloning, genetic therapy, and how genes are related to many diseases, psychological disturbances, and possibly other behaviors. In short, you are your DNA! Finally, Quantum Physics for Poets by Leon M. Lederman, a Nobel Laureate, and Christopher T. Hill ($28.00) have taken on the job of explaining the heart of contemporary physics, the basis for understanding matter in its tiniest dimensions and the vastness of the universe, and they have succeeded. They have transformed what is an enigma for most people into a highly entertaining, lucid and informative book. If you have always been curious about it, this is the book to read!

I see in Forrest Gump the most important qualities for a man to success: faith and persistence. He firmly believes in what he is doing and does everything with his full capacity. When he was young, he was only good at was running. He also enjoyed it. So he ran at his best and got into the football team, which later led him into college. In the Vietnam war, he followed the Lieutenant faithfully and treated him sincerely, which earned him a valuable lifelong friendship. Moreover, he was able to retreat when he could not fight through. He memorized Jenny’s words well: “Never try to be brave”. When one’s in overwhelming danger, the most optimal strategy is indeed saving up one’s energy for a better future.
If the book had fulfilled the promise it showed in the beginning, I might have given it five stars, but it has several serious flaws. One, as I have pointed out above, is its didacticism verging on propaganda for an oppressive regime. Another is that there are some serious unexplained plot holes.

Kapil Sibbal, Union Minister for HRD, said, “India is seeing rapid economic activity and growth. Developing India’s youth and their skills is going to play an important role in the country’s inclusive growth. The union budget also laid emphasis on skill development and so does the proposed 12th Five Year Plan with a National Policy on Skill development. The PPP model (public-private partnership) is most essential in running and managing training institutions to address the skill gap most efficiently. Microsoft’s commitment to empower students by deploying Microsoft Live@edu for 7.5 million users across the country with AICTE is commendable and a step towards an informed and developing India. I congratulate both AICTE and Microsoft on this significant milestone.”
A.: I wouldn’t say I write like he did, especially since he is one of the greatest writers of my generation, but my favorite author of recent years has been David Foster Wallace. I think I share with him a respect for rather than a loathing of popular culture, and it seeps into everything I write. Like Wallace, I prefer to stretch and to challenge readers rather than ever to underestimate them and “write down” to them. In YA, I’m especially fond of John Green, David Levithan, and Jay Asher. In practical terms and like so many others, Stephen King’s On Writing has been profoundly influential in my work. I never start a new project without reading it.

The trend that "Shutter Island" seems to be chasing is what I now call the Big Twist Narrative that seems to have plagued horror films and thrillers for the last ten years. The narratives often function as a series of twists, fakeouts and gotcha moments building to an ending designed to make you slap your head and proclaim "Holy crap! I didn't see that coming!" Who knew Rod Serling would become one of the most influential writers of our time? Most would obviously point to M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" as the Ground Zero moment when filmmakers started making movies that resembled feature-length Twilight Zone episodes. I do believe that is a bit unfair, as I still consider both the Twist in "Sense" and the story that precedes it to still be justified as a narrative about human emotions. Besides, the emotional climax of that movie was always the final scene between main character Cole Sear and his mother in the car.

I used to envy my younger brother at these times and for a number of reasons. The first being that as he always received his belting second, my dads efforts would be significantly less, having already tired out his swinging arm on me. The second, for some reason no matter how hard the punishment was and how much yelling was going on, my brother had a habit of laughing uncontrollably throughout the whole thing. I now realise that this was probably a nervous laughter, coming out of fear but at the time I just wished that I could have seen even a fracture of the humour I perceived that he was seeing. The third and probably the most valid, my brother was a naughty child, he did do things that were nasty and horrible and inexplicable. He showed no fear in his actions and if he thought something seemed like a good idea at the time, he did it. I envied the fact that even though he was being punished for his actions, at least he had the benefit of having done what he wanted and had fun doing it.

Both metaphors and similes are wonderful things in fiction--they allow us to manipulate words and make them into pictures. They make our stories visual, which means we're engaging multiple senses and the more senses you can engage, the more real your story feels. So, we shall all agree that metaphors and similes are wonderful things.

Given that the film is all about singing, there is of course a litany of catchy tunes waiting to infect your hind brain and refuse to leave for days and weeks to come.

The Hunger Games reminds me of academic work. Sure, we don’t kill one another for entertainment. And, academic life isn’t about life or death, but the stakes are high and at times people are quite petty. The Tributes, though, are the pre-tenure faculty who have to participate in the department’s arena. Some Tributes face an easier match than others, but ultimately the senior faculty and others watch and wait to see who wins. The odds are ever in your favor to: teach, write, and pay service to the department and university. But, most departments really expect you to write, keep your head down, and know your place.

I used to envy my younger brother at these times and for a number of reasons. The first being that as he always received his belting second, my dads efforts would be significantly less, having already tired out his swinging arm on me. The second, for some reason no matter how hard the punishment was and how much yelling was going on, my brother had a habit of laughing uncontrollably throughout the whole thing. I now realise that this was probably a nervous laughter, coming out of fear but at the time I just wished that I could have seen even a fracture of the humour I perceived that he was seeing. The third and probably the most valid, my brother was a naughty child, he did do things that were nasty and horrible and inexplicable. He showed no fear in his actions and if he thought something seemed like a good idea at the time, he did it. I envied the fact that even though he was being punished for his actions, at least he had the benefit of having done what he wanted and had fun doing it.
"I don't necessarily disagree with you, but please comment on what bands in 1970 were doing different from what bands had done on stage in the late 1960s. That is, please expand upon what you mean by 'concert form.' For example, how do the stacks of Marshall amps used by Hendrix and then Blue Cheer factor in as a suitable setting for the 'oversized' sound. How do other factors, such as costumes, stage props, and stage maneuvers factor in?"
The story is told of a king who had a close friend with whom he grew up.
If she were such a hardened criminal, why was she only carrying mace? If she were heavily into the drug lifestyle or possibly selling drugs, she would have been carrying a gun as well. It’s not unthinkable for a convicted felon to have a gun. In some cases, the ones who shouldn’t have them, it’s easier for them to obtain.
But not without a fight. Before the monster's death throes have run their course, the rollercoaster becomes an inferno of flames (Nesbitt and the marksman make it safely to the ground), and the rhedosaurus gets a funeral pyre to match its gargantuan size.

Max Tegmark, astrophysicist, cosmologist and professor in the physics faculty at MIT in Cambridge, Mass likes the idea of parallel universes: the quantum mechanics (QM) paradox of a particle’s ability to be in two places at the same time. He sees mathematics as our ultimate connection to reality. “Math is not something we invented, but something we are continually rediscovering.”
I have a new friend. I'll call him Adrian. Hello, Adrian - I'm sure you will recognise yourself, even with this different name. Adrian has written a long novel which he has been working on for much of this year. He has had feedback from several readers, some with publishing industry experience, so their comments are more likely to be useful than those of random friends and family. He has taken on board all their comments and made changes to his novel. I have not read his novel, nor do I intend to until it is published. I have read and commented on the synopsis and the first page - that's all. So can I be any use to Adrian in helping him develop his novel? I think so. Because I don't think I can teach him to write, but I might be able to help him to learn to write.

The abdominals weaken and lengthen during pregnancy, and I’m specifically talking about the six-pack muscle which runs from your breastbone, to your pubic bone, vertically down the front of your stomach. Sometimes these muscles separate, but not in all pregnancies. The deep, internal abdominal muscle called the Transverse Abdominis, sometimes referred to as your “core” muscle should be your main focus. Sit ups aren’t suitable for postnatal women to do, so stop them immediately if you are, and neither are forceful rotational movements where you twist your torso from right to left. It’s safer to perform Pilates-based exercises which target the pelvic floor and deep abdominal muscles or “core”, as these help stabilise your pelvis and the exercises themselves have numerous benefits.

Pat Summitt to me is like the Phil Jackson of college basketball. Jackson is one of the greatest coaches in NBA history and won 11 NBA championships as a head coach. And he knows how to coach a team. Like Jackson, Pat is like a direct replica of Jackson except she is a female. You put these two on the same team coaching, that team should win every year.
On the afternoon of Monday, January 8, 1912, Mrs. Grace Johnson, the director of the Springfield Museum of Natural History and Miss Fannie Stebbins, the supervisor of natural science for the Springfield School Department, assembled a group of amateur bird watchers and organized the Springfield Bird Club. The purpose of the club was “to attract, conserve and study birds.” A century later, the Allen Bird Club, as it soon came to be known, is still carrying out this original purpose.
The mainstream view of Brian De Palma's 2000s output is anything but flattering, with all four of his films made in the new millennium bowing to intense critical pans and commercial indifference. However, I've found his contemporary work to rank among his best. Mission to Mars captures the boundless enthusiasm (and unabashed cheesiness) of old Disney space adventures, shot to favor near-poetry over scientific accuracy and all the better for it. Femme Fatale threw people with its narrative mulligan, but it made the strongest case to date for the director's actual feelings for women, which are far more complex than the lazy accusations of misogyny that have dogged him for so long. The Black Dahlia is, if anything, the only one of De Palma's films that can even stand with Carlito's Way in terms of sheer aesthetic and Romantic beauty. Its sloppy elements and awkward acting choices only add to its deliberate, yet gentle, attack on Hollywood. It may also be the most neatly contextualized of De Palma's films in his strange canon, fitting neatly with the more formal, big-budget experiments and the uncompromising anti-mainstream tone of his '70s and '80s work.
Planning to hit the studio in early June to lay down tracks for their third album, WOE’s reworked “Quietly, Undramatically” opens a new door on the title track from the band’s popular 2010 release of the same name. Vocalist/guitarist Chris Grigg notes, “the remixed version of ‘Quietly, Undramatically’ is a more accurate representation of what was hoped to achieve with the material and offers a different perspective into the album.” Decibel Magazine said, “Woe strive for sophistication without falling into the usual pitfalls of pretentiousness, cartoonish-ness or undue gloss. Essential aggression is maintained, while the atmospheric and emotional depth envelopes are pushed with a bold fearlessness.”

D is doing well at school although we have issues to work out with her getting her ass to classes on time. She has said that she doesn't like her English teacher but it just going to have to learn how to deal with it as this is the second time she is taking the class (due to her staying home last year). Oh well, it will be a good lesson for her on how to deal with situations she doesn't control.

As with most studies, there are limitations to the data. The study focused on data from registries instead of actual ADHD patients. Data was collected for more than 150,000 individuals currently taking drugs such as Ritalin or Concerta. These persons were compared to 434,000 people who were not taking these medications. The researchers found that over 1,300 participants had a heart attack, stroke, or cardiac related death. However, the drugs were not an increased risk to the deaths. In addition, neither age nor a history of heart disease added risk to ADHD drug users. Researchers also found that the deaths were the same during the use of an ADHD drug and a year after use had ceased.

As I went down the stairs and was marching out the door a young, pretty woman came up to me and introduced herself. She said she was Laurel Wescott Rancitelli and was running for City Council and asked if I would sign her nomination papers. She told me her campaign motto is, "A Vote for Rancitelli is a Vote for Change!" I asked her about her education and she said she has a high school diploma and an Associate's Degree from STCC. I asked her why she didn't continue her education and she replied that she got such an attractive opportunity to work at a Catholic school that she couldn't turn it down. I regret that I didn't ask her position on birth control, but I signed her paper anyway and she seemed grateful, saying that she was just beginning her campaign.

The trend that "Shutter Island" seems to be chasing is what I now call the Big Twist Narrative that seems to have plagued horror films and thrillers for the last ten years. The narratives often function as a series of twists, fakeouts and gotcha moments building to an ending designed to make you slap your head and proclaim "Holy crap! I didn't see that coming!" Who knew Rod Serling would become one of the most influential writers of our time? Most would obviously point to M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" as the Ground Zero moment when filmmakers started making movies that resembled feature-length Twilight Zone episodes. I do believe that is a bit unfair, as I still consider both the Twist in "Sense" and the story that precedes it to still be justified as a narrative about human emotions. Besides, the emotional climax of that movie was always the final scene between main character Cole Sear and his mother in the car.

Why not just find the cookie she's really craving and spend her allotted calories on a truly delicious experience?

Dad said nothing. He put the tree to the side of the house and went off again to find another one. This went ahead every year. Dad would find a tree and bring it back for Mom’s approval. It usually took three or four attempts before Mom decided she liked the first one best. Dad would then strip some boughs from the others before putting them on the wood pile. He bored holes in the trunk of the Christmas tree and inserted the extra boughs to fill it out.

Wow! That is a pretty big challenge. There is a reason it is called “the shadow”. It can be a bit scary to take an honest look at what we are feeling and why. Isn’t it easier to sit in judgment and blame someone else than to take 100% responsibility for our own thoughts and actions? Ya, I think so too! But I have realized in recent days, months, years that I need to take 100% accountability for everything that happened or continues to happen in my life. Whether it’s the abuse I endured as a child, the issues in my marriage, or what I perceive to be happening within the roller derby league I was practicing with. This book reiterates what I already believe and that is that “thoughts are things” and we create our own world based on our thoughts. When I think, “Well they don’t like me and are ignoring me and leaving me out because they don’t like me” then it sets that “wish” into motion and sure enough I get more of what I perceived to be true. This just shows me that I am feeling separate from others….separate from my self…separate from God/Love. Where there is separation, there is fear. Where there is fear, there is the shadow. Where there is shadow, there is dis-ease, pain, sadness.

A ruler always makes sure the elite class is on his side. The personnel selection system is often used as a way for the emperor to share power with the elite class and thus consolidate the base of their legitimacy. From a society in which social position and political power were based largely on kinship credentials, China was transformed into a meritocracy in which social prestige and political appointment depended mostly on classical examinations to establish legitimate academic credentials (Elman, 1989). For the emperor, producing talented and loyal officials for the state to employ had been the prime concern. Also, by spreading the chances of participating in politics among the masses regardless of their family backgrounds, the emperor promulgated a feeling of equality and empowerment of the poor.

Bottom Line: HAUNTING VIOLET was there, and I read it. That pretty much sums up my feelings for it. However, looking at other reviews, it seems HAUNTING VIOLET is one of those books that's either meh or OMGAMAZING, with most people falling in the latter. So if you're an Alyxandra Harvey or ghostly mysteries fan, I recommend giving it a try. Not the right haunt for me, but maybe it will be for you.

I had never heard of the designation CODA (Child of Deaf Adult) until after I moved away from home and saw the Hallmark movie “Love is Never Silent.” In the movie, there’s a confrontational scene between the deaf parents and the hearing daughter after she’s moved away from home. During that scene, I broke down and sobbed like I’d never cried in all my life. In fact, I couldn’t even talk about that movie for a couple of years without starting to cry. I wasn’t angry with my parents. Nor do I think I had an unlucky childhood. That movie began a process which helped me learn how important it is that I embrace who I am. I am in both worlds, both deaf and hearing. My personality is different in each world. When I sign to deaf people I’m no longer shy. If I see a deaf person signing, I want to go over and introduce myself. In the hearing world, I’m much more reserved. Since then, I’ve learned to recognize that I can live in both worlds at the same time.

Since my Washington, D.C. address and the writing of this article, I conducted two vitally important pieces of research work on Dr. Bob and his younger years in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. First, my son and I visited St. Johnsbury, Vermont twice over a total period of three weeks. We were able to find literally thousands of relevant records, manuscripts, books, sermons, teachings, newspapers articles, and other writings that showed the immense Christian upbringing Dr. Bob had as a youngster in Vermont. His upbringing involved the Great Awakening of 1875 which preceded his birth but impacted on the entire community of St. Johnsbury. It involved his Congregationalist parents and their indoctrination of Bob with facts about salvation and the Word of God. It involved the North Congregational Church of St. Johnsbury, Vermont where the entire Smith family attended church services at least 4 times each week. The father was a Deacon, a member of the Executive Committee, and a Sunday school teacher. The mother helped write a history of the church, headed its Christian education program, sang in the choir, and was active in many church activities. The Young Men’s Christian Association, as well as the Young People’s Society of Christian Endeavor, played a major role in the church; and the YMCA, of which Bob’s father was President, was also active in St. Johnsbury Academy which Dr. Bob attended.

A couple of evenings ago I watched a documentary on TV about Tony Onley. I was inspired by something that Jack Shadbolt said. It was not his words per se but the cultural attitude that he and Onley had about ‘art’ last century – specifically painting. I mused that it would be so fun if there was a daily TV show on interviewing eclectic people about art. Some interviewees could be ‘experts’ – professors of art history, painting, art criticism; some gallery owners, curators, jurists; practitioners of contemporary art; or art collectors of all stripes. Others could include exhibition opening visitors and supporters, those who have never been to a gallery or artists discussing various topics including directions in their current work. Let’s get back the passion people. Onley, Shadbolt, Wyman and others discussed painting with enthusiasm.

Come and look me in the eye and tell me this isn't a cool cover. I dare you. Ack-Ack Macaque has to be one of the oddest titles to come from genre publishers this year. To date Gareth L. Powell has published one novel with The Recollection and also the novella Silversands. Both are far-future Sci-Fi that most would put in the Space Opera camp. So Ack-Ack Macaque is definitely a step in a new direction for him, but the story does have its roots in one of his short stories of the same name published in 2007. With a cover like this it would be criminal of me not to read it. It has got a smoking money on it for book's sake! Here's the blurb:

I never intended to keep orphaned socks forever…I just put them in the basket and waited for the mates to show up so that the orphans could be reunited. My naiveté knows no bounds!
The Koetong Pub was built back in 1883 as a coach house and rest-stop along what is now the Snowy Valleys Way – a nice drive comprising a nice lazy arc that runs from Beechworth in North-East Victoria to Gundagai in New South Wales and manages to shoe-horn 45 pubs into a drive that might take no more than a few hours.
He would win true acclaim and popularity, however, as the city's district attorney proper, serving first from 1853-1859 and again from 1861-1869, one of New York's most important legal voices during the Civil War. He allegedly prosecuted over 12,000 cases. He was also on hand during the Draft Riots, funneling many rioters through the court system and straight to jail. His accomplice was often judge John Hoffman, soon to be the mayor of New York who preceded Hall. Their crusades against rioters would boost both their popularity.
I wonder, while I sip, who will miss me? Who will feel sorry they didn’t take me seriously last time. Some people, I regret to say, probably won’t. There are some hard and cynical people out there. But plenty more will shed tears, and stare incredulously at those who don’t care.

Thankfully the cold spell has relented and Friday will see the brewery fired up for the first time in 2012. My only reservations are that I'm out for a few beers on the Thursday evening, so I might well have a sore head when the time comes to switch on the HLT, which will be pretty early as I like to get finished while there's still daylight. The second reservation is the pump.
I love making images that show the environment at weddings. I think this image of Loc and Sadie's ceremony from a distance during the storm is just amazing. It says so much about them and the love their friends and family have for them. Loc and Sadie's closest family and friends stood steady in the storm, freezing (my hands froze up) and getting soaked to the bones to show their support. I know that as years pass the spiritual connection to this spot on the hillside will grow not only for Loc and Sadie, but for all who were there.
Viloria ended the sixth by pinning Miranda against the ropes and landed a left to the head just before the bell. Another body shot knocked Miranda into the ropes early in the seventh and Viloria connected on several combinations that appeared to have Miranda in trouble.

Perhaps I have too high expectations, but then I know you set high expectations for yourself and all those who work with you. The film felt like you were on cruise control, only operating at 70% of your abilities. If the original film didn’t exist we would be saying it is a good film, not amazing, but that it was a fairly decent story but unlikely to be remembered years down the line. However, the original does exist and so we can make a direct comparison.

When my children are very young, they are not always able to understand and consider my needs. The friendships may look lopsided, just as some of my adult friendships do when one of us is going through difficult times. But I trust that if my children grow up being treated like my friends, they will know how to be friends. I look forward to great friendships with both of them. A war involves hostages. In some parent-child relationships, the child is almost like a hostage. But friendship does not involve hostages.

Cameron hit into 200 fewer double plays than Rice.

What I really loved about this recipe though is that you prepare it the night before and it's all ready to go the next morning. Brilliant! I adore waffles on the weekend but sometimes I just want to sit with my coffee and relax rather than make a big breakfast. It was so nice to plug in the waffle iron and have a steamy hot fluffy waffle on my plate a few minutes later. Love this and will definitely make again!

I see in Forrest Gump the most important qualities for a man to success: faith and persistence. He firmly believes in what he is doing and does everything with his full capacity. When he was young, he was only good at was running. He also enjoyed it. So he ran at his best and got into the football team, which later led him into college. In the Vietnam war, he followed the Lieutenant faithfully and treated him sincerely, which earned him a valuable lifelong friendship. Moreover, he was able to retreat when he could not fight through. He memorized Jenny’s words well: “Never try to be brave”. When one’s in overwhelming danger, the most optimal strategy is indeed saving up one’s energy for a better future.
Once you are done spraying carefully clean up your star dies with a little bit of hand sanitizer. This contains alcohol and will remove all the marker from the metal very easily.

This test will be of individual words and non-words. Pupils will be asked to show that they can offer the correct readings for the real words and plausible readings for the non-words ie pronouncing the letters and letter-combinations with the sounds that the children have been taught. So, for example a non-word with the 'ou' letters in the middle could be pronounced either as 'ou' in 'sound' or as 'ou' in 'wound' (as in 'hurt') (all southern English pronunciations). Whether they could pronounce it as the 'ou' in 'touch' is, I think, unlikely. We shall see whether 'rare' pronunciations will be allowed when the actual test comes out.
When people like MP Stephen Woodworth step up and call for higher welfare rates for single mothers or for that matter a help for families living in poverty and a strong social safety net so we can raise every child out of poverty, then I will believe when they bring up the abortion issue, they really have the childrens welfare at heart!

The basic premise of all three movies is that corporal punishment is used to discipline female inmates in prison. The first movie begins with a prisoner (Dominika) rejecting the sexual advances of a guard (Kelly, who appears in all three movies). Kelly retaliates by reporting to the Sergeant of the Guard that she has been attack by the prisoner. Of course, such acts are not to be tolerated so Dominika is brought to the guard house where she is bent over a table, bound by her wrists and her skirt is raised. Her punishment begins with a leather strap but this doesn't last long. Next, her legs are bound to the table legs and her punishment continues with the cane. The caning is 24 strokes, by my count, and it lasts over 5 minutes in the movie. It is shown from several camera angles but one is partially obstructed by a cement wall or post.

Before I share the snippets with you, I have another reminder and the announcement of today's challenge.
Wow! That is a pretty big challenge. There is a reason it is called “the shadow”. It can be a bit scary to take an honest look at what we are feeling and why. Isn’t it easier to sit in judgment and blame someone else than to take 100% responsibility for our own thoughts and actions? Ya, I think so too! But I have realized in recent days, months, years that I need to take 100% accountability for everything that happened or continues to happen in my life. Whether it’s the abuse I endured as a child, the issues in my marriage, or what I perceive to be happening within the roller derby league I was practicing with. This book reiterates what I already believe and that is that “thoughts are things” and we create our own world based on our thoughts. When I think, “Well they don’t like me and are ignoring me and leaving me out because they don’t like me” then it sets that “wish” into motion and sure enough I get more of what I perceived to be true. This just shows me that I am feeling separate from others….separate from my self…separate from God/Love. Where there is separation, there is fear. Where there is fear, there is the shadow. Where there is shadow, there is dis-ease, pain, sadness.
It really wasn't until I got quite a bit older that I fully understood how much antipathy some people had for the DH and how National League fans were pretty certain that their league was the only one playing "pure" baseball. Funny: As a kid I had always thought National League baseball was kind of boring. I mean, you give me a choice to watch Rico Carty wind his bat and glare down a pitcher or watch Buzz Capra bunt … that was no contest for me.
Discipline in schools is important to ensure a positive learning environment for all. I think clear, applicable, and relevant policies outlining behaviors and consequences is one way to ensure students and teachers feel safe to learn. These policies should be school (and perhaps even district) wide, applied consistently, and be fair to all students. Every student has the right to learn in a safe and secure environment and teachers deserve to teach in safe and secure schools.

Maybe you would like a critique, but can't afford one. Or perhaps you've just never got round to organising this kind of feedback.

We went ringing at Al Ali Farm in the afternoon last weekend. I had only been ringing at this site once before and it looks like a great site. There are plenty of tall trees, shrubs and open fields and a lot of birds where about. In the trees we set three nets hoping to catch Rufous-tailed Scrub Robin and Common Redstart which were seen in good numbers as we were setting up the nets. We also hoped we could catch a few Ortolan buntings in the grass field as Brendan and Nicole had caught 21 birds there the weekend before in one attempt. As it turned out most of the Ortolan Buntings had moved on and plenty of House Sparrows were in the fields along with a number of Daurian Shrikes and Turkestan Shrikes. Abdulla came for an hour and hoped to catch a Lesser Grey Shrike that he had seen but it evaded the trap and was not caught. …

Jared Priestley came on in the seventh to finish the game, striking out two and allowing just one hit. Brady Fuller earned the win for Roseburg to get his second victory as a pitcher. Priestley earned his first save of the season.
We all had so much fun working on our very pink dress up inspiration shoot. It was (for me) the first time working with children in multiples, which could have ended up going in any direction really. It was all good, although there was a teeny petulant area when they got to the table and found out they would have to wait another three minutes before they were actually allowed to eat the pretty cakes :)

This lasted for a few moments before she came back to her senses. She then pulled her coat around her and stood to leave. The pigeon hopped politely to one side. She hadn't even noticed me. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, people rarely do. My teeth ground together as I felt the anger rising in me. I watched her leave, and made a split second decision to head after her. I hung back a bit, I didn't want her to notice me now. Not yet anyway.
Anyway, enough of my ranting. Austin was delicious and also rad.

I think their orientation was changing. We were really into Tweez, we were totally obsessed with that record. When Spiderland came out, a bunch of us said, "oh, well, I don't know about this..." That's pretty well stood the test of time. I've heard that record a few too many times, for sure, but side one of that you can't even touch. It's just really spectacular. And they did that when they were 20? They were really young when they did that.

On a practical level, site your plot within easy reach of a water supply. If the summer is dry you’ll be glad of a nearby tap. Also think about access for wheelbarrows so that you can manoeuvre around the area easily if you need to bring in heavy sacks of compost or take rubbish away to your compost heaps.
We see this in Hebrews 10:19-22, where we are encouraged to come near to God in “the house of God” through the torn “veil” of the broken “flesh”, and through the shed blood, which is “sprinkled” (cp. 9:21) on our hearts, of Christ the “High Priest”. It is impossible to exclude the Eucharist from our interpretation of this passage, especially since this entrance into “the Holiest” is said to be a “new and living way”, while the Eucharist, which also happens in the house of God, the Church, is called the “new covenant”.
It took them rather longer, looking back, than one might have expected, but they obviously thought very hard, particularly after the second summer, 2007, and said, "We're not going to get anywhere taking on the British soldiers at what they do best; ergo we will find another way".

The obligatory follow up questions:
Come and look me in the eye and tell me this isn't a cool cover. I dare you. Ack-Ack Macaque has to be one of the oddest titles to come from genre publishers this year. To date Gareth L. Powell has published one novel with The Recollection and also the novella Silversands. Both are far-future Sci-Fi that most would put in the Space Opera camp. So Ack-Ack Macaque is definitely a step in a new direction for him, but the story does have its roots in one of his short stories of the same name published in 2007. With a cover like this it would be criminal of me not to read it. It has got a smoking money on it for book's sake! Here's the blurb:

There are a few tactics used to gain subscribers. Some sites hit you with a popup as soon as you come to it, asking you to subscribe. I for one abhor these popups (to spite claims they work), because if I haven’t even read your content yet, no way am I going to start handing you my information (even tho I am sure you will respect all my privacy).

Throughout the album, there are moments of musical bliss that supersede any of the narrative or thematic content, such as the violins swelling up ecstatically at the 2:05 marker of "Saro", the many extended rings of piano and banjo in "Wild Bill Jones", the crack of Amidon's voice as he stretches for the high notes in "O Death", or the growing sense of anticipation expressed by the growing number of instruments in "All is Well". Nico Muhly, whose 2008 watermark of modern classical Mothertongue was among the many albums I considered for this Record Club pick, has an instinctive feel for orchestration that seems to be heightened when paired with other artists, so much so that as much as Muhly's sensibilities challenge Amidon, Amidon's spare folk forces Muhly to temper his sometimes madcap and unrestricted tendencies. Combining the legato string arrangements of Arvo Pärt, the fluttery bells and whistles of Sufjan Stevens, and the forceful repetitions of Phillip Glass yet maintaining a distinctive oddness of his own, Muhly brings surprising beauty to these songs, a measure of pastoral charm and fairy-tale whimsy that is able to dance around Amidon's voice in unpredictable but never overbearing ways. Furthemore, Valgeir's touches, less noticeable but no less affecting, offer subliminal hints of modern electronica and electro-acoustic improvisation, not to mention his high-fidelity engineering of the record gives great room for the instruments to reverberate in space.

The child whose parents could never afford the bike, the pretty doll, or the loving teddy bear and who smells the ham baking, sees and knows another kind of Santa who makes the lives of these children miraculous for a day as well as sends them to bed with a full stomach, if they are Blessed enough to receive from the kindness of others.
Anyway, it's a little sad to know that many girls/people here (and in other places) wish that they were lighter. I guess from where I'm standing, I think all different skin types are beautiful. I may go on and on about how gorgeous people are in India and Nicaragua and places like that, but that doesn't mean that I necessarily wish I looked like them. I'm fine with my skin color and it's sad that some people aren't.

The ceremony itself was a fascinating affair. Elliot walked in, pulling a blindfolded Flora behind him. And the two of them took to a large stage with their parents and a couple of guys with microphones. These MCs conducted the ceremony in Chinese and English so everyone knew what was going on. And it was all sealed and done with some tearing and throwing of lettuce and the releasing of balloons.
Direct taxation has been reduced for the super-rich, and there has been a rise in the general tax allowance. Isn't allowance an interesting word? Yes, the Establishment have decided that we are 'allowed' to keep a little more of our own money; brazenly stating that they have control over our money! This rise in the untaxed 'allowance' is immediately wiped out by a massive rise in the cost of petrol and diesel. In the topsy-turvy UK, there are no measures to discourage employers employing people not living locally, so commuting is a fact of life for most people. The increase in fuel 'duty' (again, an interesting word!) simply transfers the money not stolen by direct taxation, to theft by indirect taxation. Considering the cost of fuel, the result of the two measures is to rob the people of more of our money, whilst appearing to take less. To emphasise this theft, fuel duty increases this week, but the tax allowance does not rise for a full twelve months.

Take the L train to Graham Ave. (Brooklyn!) Walking directions are as follows: Walk East on Metropolitan Avenue towards Humboldt. You want to get to Woodpoint Road, so you can do that by taking the awkward diagonal Maspeth Ave, which is definitely faster. If you miss it, just turn right on Conselyea Street. Turn left on Woodpoint, and walk walk walk northeast, until you hit Kingsland Ave, then turn left again. As you approach the not-so-sexy underbelly of the BQE, you should find the magic street Lombardy and turn right! Walk on Lombardy until you hit 171 Lombardy, and you've found it.

Planning to hit the studio in early June to lay down tracks for their third album, WOE’s reworked “Quietly, Undramatically” opens a new door on the title track from the band’s popular 2010 release of the same name. Vocalist/guitarist Chris Grigg notes, “the remixed version of ‘Quietly, Undramatically’ is a more accurate representation of what was hoped to achieve with the material and offers a different perspective into the album.” Decibel Magazine said, “Woe strive for sophistication without falling into the usual pitfalls of pretentiousness, cartoonish-ness or undue gloss. Essential aggression is maintained, while the atmospheric and emotional depth envelopes are pushed with a bold fearlessness.”

I believe that the goal should change from making children happy and protecting them from harm to raising them to be independent adults able to problem-solve and cope in the real and sometimes difficult adult world. A safety net can become a trap. Dependence on one’s parents means lack of real security and often results in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It's nonsense. Someone has written another book about how kids these days never grow up, and how it's all the parents' fault for being too helpful, too involved, too available. Read more about it here. Apparently, parents need to set more boundaries, have higher expectations, force independence at a younger age. The goal of parenting should be independence instead of happiness?! Dependence leads to low self-esteem?! Security makes us feel insecure?! I disagree.

If the book had fulfilled the promise it showed in the beginning, I might have given it five stars, but it has several serious flaws. One, as I have pointed out above, is its didacticism verging on propaganda for an oppressive regime. Another is that there are some serious unexplained plot holes.

Everyday, I read quotations by many different people who in some way or another have inspired me or who's work has resonated within me. Words are such powerful weapons, quotations can alter my mindset, comfort me, make me re-asess... but either way it's the power of words which at an early age drew me to get pen to paper and begin writing, the idea that words can have such a profound effect on people on a deeper level and higher consciousness is astounding.
I am writing this awkwardly with one of my cats on the desk half lying on the key board – a favourite position of his I wouldn’t dream of interfering with. His sister prefers to watch television. I have been answering emails (tardily – post a virus and subsequent new laptop) from many of you through both the blog and the website and I am just amazed at the interest in Christian and the emotion he still generates. Please keep sending me stories about your own animals, or YouTube links of cats (or dogs!), or what Christian means to you. I’m sure we are building an invaluable archive.
There's no point being scared of what I write because I can change it.
I have one of those phone messages people complain about. I tell callers what number they have dialed and kindly ask them to leave a message if they are so inclined. My mother hates my message. She asks how people will know whom they’ve reached. I figure you either know me and will leave a message or you hope you know me, leave a message and take your chances. The last thing I want to do is give someone from whom I may not want to hear more information about me. I don’t want to validate telemarketers or let the robocallers know that they’ve reached a live one.

We went ringing at Al Ali Farm in the afternoon last weekend. I had only been ringing at this site once before and it looks like a great site. There are plenty of tall trees, shrubs and open fields and a lot of birds where about. In the trees we set three nets hoping to catch Rufous-tailed Scrub Robin and Common Redstart which were seen in good numbers as we were setting up the nets. We also hoped we could catch a few Ortolan buntings in the grass field as Brendan and Nicole had caught 21 birds there the weekend before in one attempt. As it turned out most of the Ortolan Buntings had moved on and plenty of House Sparrows were in the fields along with a number of Daurian Shrikes and Turkestan Shrikes. Abdulla came for an hour and hoped to catch a Lesser Grey Shrike that he had seen but it evaded the trap and was not caught. …

Santorum: Mitt Romney pandered
As a wee boy growing up in Edinburgh, I remember dressing up as Dracula on Halloween night. Besides preparing me with the requisite black hair and fangs, mum also handed me a turnip as I walked out the door. In Scotland it’s not “trick-or treating”, it’s “guising” and instead of carving pumpkins, we carve turnips. Every year my brothers and I would go out guising together. In this tradition when you arrive at each door, you first recite a poem, sing a song, do a magic trick, or perform some other form of entertainment to persuade an offering of a treat. If your performance wasn’t well-received, you might get nowt (nothing)! (In the high school years, retaliation for this rejection was sometimes given through an egging, which, of course, I never participated in.) While we walked the neighborhood, my brothers and I would carry our carved turnips, called turnip lanterns, to light the way.

Tape/staple (optional)
With a screenplay by Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel and Edward Bunker that was based on a script written by none other than Akira Kurosawa, Runaway Train aims to be the kind of mix of action-movie thrills, character study and philosophical discourse that Kurosawa often excelled at in his heyday. It thoroughly fulfills its first aim, with a handful of edge-of-your-seat stunts, action sequences and high-powered collisions to satisfy the popcorn crowd. As a character study, though, it's more problematic. Some of the dialogue is so ham-fisted in trying to explore its themes that it's almost a miracle that the actors manage to find imaginative ways to deliver it; on the other hand, some of that acting is just so mannered and hysterical—and alas, yes, that includes the performances of the two Oscar-nominated leads, Jon Voight and (especially) Eric Roberts—that the characters themselves never quite transcend their obvious places in the script's grand allegorical design.

Come and look me in the eye and tell me this isn't a cool cover. I dare you. Ack-Ack Macaque has to be one of the oddest titles to come from genre publishers this year. To date Gareth L. Powell has published one novel with The Recollection and also the novella Silversands. Both are far-future Sci-Fi that most would put in the Space Opera camp. So Ack-Ack Macaque is definitely a step in a new direction for him, but the story does have its roots in one of his short stories of the same name published in 2007. With a cover like this it would be criminal of me not to read it. It has got a smoking money on it for book's sake! Here's the blurb:

Unlike the Facebook and LinkedIn UIs, which provide lists of people you do know and a list of people you should know, Levo League’s welcome page presents you with something a bit more aspirational — a corner office. The UI is beautiful, and you can navigate to a career search, office hours, mentoring from successful women and other yet-to-be-launched features. Mentoring topics include workplace relationship advice, professional fashion guidance, how to ask for a raise and some of the “softer skills” around success that you typically have to learn as you go, or you consult your mom or sister.
The fact that the 10-year period certain option costs very little extra is a factor, too, he says. For example, a $100,000 SPIA purchased by a 65-year-old man above would pay roughly $574 a month if he buys a $100,000 life-only SPIA, but only $23 less ($553 a month) if the SPIA is a life with 10-year period certain products.

TripleF and I almost never hung out alone, so I was pretty stoked one night when she texted me, asking if I wanted to go to the bar with her–just the two of us. She said she had a friend performing a song at a bar, and needed someone to go with. I had spent all Saturday morning and afternoon in the architecture design studios, and I was definitely ready for some excitement. However, the bright side of working in studio on weekends is that it is very easy to bring your alcohol in with you, which I did. By the time I left studio, I was very happily buzzed, and a couple more drinks would’ve pushed me into the “drunk” category.

This lasted for a few moments before she came back to her senses. She then pulled her coat around her and stood to leave. The pigeon hopped politely to one side. She hadn't even noticed me. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, people rarely do. My teeth ground together as I felt the anger rising in me. I watched her leave, and made a split second decision to head after her. I hung back a bit, I didn't want her to notice me now. Not yet anyway.
#738 - Tabu, A Story of the South Seas (1931) - (#228 on TSPDT) This Muranu film (co-directed of sorts with Robert Flaherty), the director's final film, released just after his death, is the highest ranked film in this update, and for the most part (excepting the two Renoir and Flaherty's own Louisiana Story) deserves to be. A fascinating look at tribal culture and law in the form of a tragic romance. History tells us that Flaherty was not happy with Murnau's screenplay - calling it too westernized - but even with this dissent, the combination of the German auteur's directorial prowess and Flaherty's naturalistic filmmaking style, make for a surprisingly intriguing work of cinematic art. I suppose considering this is a film from these two men, I should not be all that surprised at its bravura standing.

You may ask, then, why I have chosen a ball perched atop a steep hill to represent the very foundation of contemporary society. I make no claims of any great knowledge in neurology, psychology, anthropology, or sociology, but there is one characteristic of our society that my own observations have repeatedly led me to: this hill, this very foundation, is unstable. At any point, a small amount of force applied in the right direction can start the ball rolling back down, back to stable ground, to the agrarian, community-based economics practiced for so much of human history. A small shift in day-to-day life, or the rediscovery of a older, simpler tradition that, in the hustle and bustle of modern life, we didn’t realize we had forgotten – these little events on a societal or, more likely, personal level, can start the ball rolling. Moreover, if strong enough, they can completely derail all of the artificiality, materialism, and vice which have been forced upon us (by whom?: that is a whole discussion in itself), in order to separate us from our roots and keep us in a state of near-subservience.

He would win true acclaim and popularity, however, as the city's district attorney proper, serving first from 1853-1859 and again from 1861-1869, one of New York's most important legal voices during the Civil War. He allegedly prosecuted over 12,000 cases. He was also on hand during the Draft Riots, funneling many rioters through the court system and straight to jail. His accomplice was often judge John Hoffman, soon to be the mayor of New York who preceded Hall. Their crusades against rioters would boost both their popularity.

Our Constitution was not designed as a plaything for pandering demagogues to act out their altruistic Robin Hood fantasies. Government functionaries at all levels were meant to be servants of the people, with their activities closely monitored and regulated by the people – not the other way around. It only established a federation of thirteen individual sovereign states, as a combination free trade agreement (think European Union) and mutual defense pact (think NATO). Unrestrained commerce, sound money, and international relations were what was foremost on our Founders’ minds as they debated how best to govern themselves as a nation – not regulating the activities of individual citizens, whom they regarded as the true sovereigns in their classical liberal view of Natural Law. By design, the power of the Federal government to interfere in the affairs of its constituent states was extremely limited. Its ability to interfere in the routine daily lives of their citizens was virtually nonexistent.

Society encourages us to think of boobs as somehow separate from the woman they’re attached to, is the problem. For men this probably makes life easier – they can enjoy staring at boobs without feeling awkward, because they can turn off their awareness of the woman the boobs are attached to. But for women it creates massive cognitive dissonance, because it’s bizarre to think of part of yourself as essentially disembodied. And for women who’re bi it’s even weirder, because we have the same “stare at boobs” impulse as straight men do, but we also know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of the stare.

Now to be fair, most of the press stories quoted above do make it clear that individual employers will still have a steep hill to climb in justifying forced retirement. You could pick fault here and there with the detail but there are lots of quotes from lawyers trying to explain the case in simple terms and emphasising that each case has to be judged on its own merits. Once you get past the headlines, I think the press have generally done a good job, all things considered.
I was rather glad afterwards. I'd had the chance to get myself angry at a missed chance and be difficult, I was glad I didn't though and through accepting the situation as it was and not being difficult I managed to get hold of something that was even more than I'd hoped for in the beginning. For me, once again, an important lesson in both patience and humility. The world doesn't revolve around me or my wishes, by taking things as they come and accepting the situation as it is, I open myself for completely new things I'd neither expected nor hoped for.

Are there other reasons why a listing may be exempt? Absolutely. Maybe an executive is making a job transfer or there is a pending divorce and the home owners just don’t want to draw attention to their situation by having a “For Sale” sign in their front yard.

It is much harder to sell a home that we can’t advertise but for those of us that are connected in the community, surrounding areas & have a large network – it is doable. Once again, all it takes is that “right” buyer and if as a home owner, you are not listed, that “right” buyer will find something else.

I was utterly motified, but managed to play it off well. I was super embarrassed because if she saw it and had that reaction, how was I going to deal with it when I took it to UPS?? Thinking about it has me cringing even though I’m just returning things that were shipped to me on accident. Nothing to be embarrassed about, Girl!
Also, I noticed that Models Own were saying that the store would have some exclusives which they may well do, I was too enamoured with the Hed Kandi polishes that I totally forgot to ask about these but will be doing so when I get back.

Then, one day, The Boy saw that his Sister took The Book. He didn’t think much of it, after all, it wasn’t his so he did not object. His Sister started to see the beauty of The Book, how nicely bound it was and the font used and she started to casually browse through it, having recently read a couple of books casually as well. She even brought a book along to the library, a book she’s been trying to read for 2 years seriously now, and The Book questioned The Boy about it.
No. Not really! The problem is that I can’t think of anything better to do with my life.

I praise the Lord for this reverent caution that he has given me and I need to realize that this kind of dependence is what should always characterize my heart, but the handful of weeks that I get to preach each year make me fearful of that time when I will preach almost every week. See, our church is planning on sending me out to another community close by to plant a church in the not too distant future and I will take on the responsibility of weekly bringing God’s truth to his people. My fear is that I will get used to preaching. By “get used to” I don’t mean a familiarity with preaching that will allow me to loosen up in the pulpit and preach with more focus and conviction. Rather, by “get used to” I mean that familiarity with preaching by which I stop depending on God so much and start depending on myself. I’m fearful of getting used to preaching in such a way that leads me to lose that sense of reverence for God’s Word and start flying by the seat of my pants as I proclaim it.

The trend that "Shutter Island" seems to be chasing is what I now call the Big Twist Narrative that seems to have plagued horror films and thrillers for the last ten years. The narratives often function as a series of twists, fakeouts and gotcha moments building to an ending designed to make you slap your head and proclaim "Holy crap! I didn't see that coming!" Who knew Rod Serling would become one of the most influential writers of our time? Most would obviously point to M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" as the Ground Zero moment when filmmakers started making movies that resembled feature-length Twilight Zone episodes. I do believe that is a bit unfair, as I still consider both the Twist in "Sense" and the story that precedes it to still be justified as a narrative about human emotions. Besides, the emotional climax of that movie was always the final scene between main character Cole Sear and his mother in the car.
The annual Nude campaign that Marie Claire has grown quite famous for over the years, wherein a handful of cause-inspired, famous South Africans in the fields of entertainment and business amongst others, communicate their ideologies so bravely, in support of the notion of respect for the human (and animal) entity – with a mega focus on the body, raising deep rooted issues, funds and ultimately, AWARENESS.

On the afternoon of Monday, January 8, 1912, Mrs. Grace Johnson, the director of the Springfield Museum of Natural History and Miss Fannie Stebbins, the supervisor of natural science for the Springfield School Department, assembled a group of amateur bird watchers and organized the Springfield Bird Club. The purpose of the club was “to attract, conserve and study birds.” A century later, the Allen Bird Club, as it soon came to be known, is still carrying out this original purpose.

The next day, we drove towards our next stop, Hot Springs, Arkansas. I’d always wanted to go and heard about the wonderful therapeutic hot baths they have with all the natural hot spring water – I’m always looking for relief from the nagging pain in my ankle from an old skateboard injury. On our drive up, it started raining cats & dogs but soon, the intense weather passed. Later that evening, when we had checked into the Hot Springs KOA, #1 son called to warn us about the tornadoes that had pummelled parts of Dallas – I told him we were okay – we were spared! Annie & I had two very relaxing nights in Hot Springs. The only noise I heard was the wind and birds singing in the morning. My friend Mike asked me to bring him home a piece of crystal – I didn’t know but the crystals are a by-product of the hot springs. We went to a place called Coleman’s Rocks & Gems and picked up some very cool crystal rock formations. In the beginning, I thought Hot Springs was a National Park like Yosemite but it’s not like that – the whole area was designated as a NP. We walked downtown and stopped in the historic Arlington Hotel, once frequented by gangsters, celebrities, and baseball teams (many teams had Spring training in Hot Springs). We enjoyed a couple nice meals, including a famous BBQ joint called McClard’s – had a very nice broasted chicken with their signature cole slaw and fries. We slept good and the setting at the KOA was quiet with lots of singing birds to calm my nerves.

Add 1 tbsp oil to large non-stick stock pot (I used my Mario Batali Dutch Oven) over med-high heat. Brown chicken, about 2 minutes per side, and then remove. Add 1 tbsp oil, fennel and onion to same skillet. Sauté until golden brown in spots and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Return chicken to pot, add broth and lemon juice. Bring to simmer, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until chicken is cooked through and sauce begins to thicken, about 20 minutes. Stir in cilantro just before serving, and add salt and pepper to taste.
I have come to the conclusion that I was really more affected by that Barracuda eating Nemo's mum than I originally thought at the time and subconsciously I am creating a fish haven for all the orphaned Nemos of the world.

Well, let’s see. There are lots of different sorts of conversations one might want to have about a claim like that: conversations, say, about what it is to explain something, and about what it is to be a law of nature, and about what it is to be a physical thing. But since the space I have is limited, let me put those niceties aside and try to be quick, and crude, and concrete.

I am reminded of James Howard Kunstler's admonition that during times of great stress mass delusions of deliverance--in this case through technology--are often afoot. I cannot fault fusion researchers for working on the intriguing problem of sustaining a fusion reaction that will produce more energy than it consumes. Nor can I fault them for seeking out the safest fuel possible. But the drumbeat in the media that alternatives are just around the corner--if we will only do things such as set up a Moon base and mine the surface--take the public's eye off more viable responses.
Before the 1830s, trains had not yet spread widely across the English country side and many factories still relied on canals for the transport of raw materials and goods to market. The postal system and its need to carry mail and people along particular routes required reform and refurbishment of the infrastructure during the late Regency period. Thomas Telford and John McAdam (of the Tar-McAdam or tarmac fame despite his not using tar in his construction, but possibly because of family business in the 18th century involving tar and shipbuilding) led to widespread renovations and improvements (in terms of the roads taking people where they wanted to go) on the Roman roads, including the Great North Road, the corridor between London and Edinburgh that is now called the A1.
In order to infuse a bit of Irish culture into our wedding, after the rehearsal dinner we decided to have a traditional seisiún (session) with a live Irish band and lots of Guinness and Irish Coffee. It was wild and we had all the guests doing ‘Riverdance’ type moves all night! The day of the wedding we rented a red double decker bus to take the wedding party and our families to and from the ceremony, it was a hit! Definitely went along with our vintage Ireland theme. We also included some traditional Irish dishes like Leek & Potato soup and Irish Smoked Salmon on the dinner menu.

My wife and I are one of many same-sex couples who lived under a strange compromise. I'll try to recap succinctly. We married in Massachusetts on December 31, 2004. Our marriage was legally invalidated by judges because we were not residents of Massachusetts, and there was a law against letting out-of-state couples marry there if their marriage would be illegal in their home state. (The original intent of the law was to prevent interracial couples from traveling out-of-state to marry in Massachusetts, which demonstrates how intertwined all sorts of oppression are.) Then that law was overturned, and around the same time, the State of New York began to honor marriages that had been contracted *out* of state. As in, one couldn't legally marry a same-sex partner in New York, but could marry out of state. L'Ailee and I went back to Massachusetts as close as we could to our anniversary and re-married.

As with most right wing thinking, austerity is born from a lack of thought. It is a simple fact that cutting services means fewer jobs and raising taxes means people are worse off. The more unemployed you have the greater the drain on the economy, as the Government has to pay benefits but receive no taxes. The unemployment benefit is so laughable that people on it can’t usually spend anything outside of the basics, and so the economy loses out on sales, and the government loses out on VAT. Next, because the media constantly tells us we are in recession again, those people with jobs save their money. When they don’t spend, the shops lose out and in the worst cases have to enter insolvency, thus throwing another group of people out into unemployment. Cut, paste, repeat.

I was already brainstorming in my head how I would do it, what I'd do with the leftover insides of the egg, what colors/flavors of jello I would use ... and then while I was at the grocery store later that week, I found this crazy gadget - it's specifically meant for making jello eggs! Best of all, it was free with the purchase of 3 boxes of jello! Score!

Both metaphors and similes are wonderful things in fiction--they allow us to manipulate words and make them into pictures.

“The reign of the camera had begun. I cannot pretend that I was aware of the implications of my protracted Saturday afternoon communings with shadows flickering across a screen, but it is certainly true that, increasingly, when I emerged, what was outside took on the character of the pictures I had been looking at, rather than the other way round. All the world in a picture palace.” (69)
Wow! That is a pretty big challenge. There is a reason it is called “the shadow”. It can be a bit scary to take an honest look at what we are feeling and why. Isn’t it easier to sit in judgment and blame someone else than to take 100% responsibility for our own thoughts and actions? Ya, I think so too! But I have realized in recent days, months, years that I need to take 100% accountability for everything that happened or continues to happen in my life. Whether it’s the abuse I endured as a child, the issues in my marriage, or what I perceive to be happening within the roller derby league I was practicing with. This book reiterates what I already believe and that is that “thoughts are things” and we create our own world based on our thoughts. When I think, “Well they don’t like me and are ignoring me and leaving me out because they don’t like me” then it sets that “wish” into motion and sure enough I get more of what I perceived to be true. This just shows me that I am feeling separate from others….separate from my self…separate from God/Love. Where there is separation, there is fear. Where there is fear, there is the shadow. Where there is shadow, there is dis-ease, pain, sadness.

The basic premise of all three movies is that corporal punishment is used to discipline female inmates in prison. The first movie begins with a prisoner (Dominika) rejecting the sexual advances of a guard (Kelly, who appears in all three movies). Kelly retaliates by reporting to the Sergeant of the Guard that she has been attack by the prisoner. Of course, such acts are not to be tolerated so Dominika is brought to the guard house where she is bent over a table, bound by her wrists and her skirt is raised. Her punishment begins with a leather strap but this doesn't last long. Next, her legs are bound to the table legs and her punishment continues with the cane. The caning is 24 strokes, by my count, and it lasts over 5 minutes in the movie. It is shown from several camera angles but one is partially obstructed by a cement wall or post.

We take pride is supporting 5,000 international missionaries, but that is only .03 percent of Southern Baptists. It is not even one out of every three thousand church members, yet it strains our resources to support that number. If we were really serious about reaching the world and recognized God had blessed us as a denomination to fulfill His mission, would it not be unreasonable that 1 percent our church members would be called to go as missionaries? That would be not 5,000 but 160,000! What potential would that have for eradicating lostness and taking the gospel to all peoples!

Planning to hit the studio in early June to lay down tracks for their third album, WOE’s reworked “Quietly, Undramatically” opens a new door on the title track from the band’s popular 2010 release of the same name. Vocalist/guitarist Chris Grigg notes, “the remixed version of ‘Quietly, Undramatically’ is a more accurate representation of what was hoped to achieve with the material and offers a different perspective into the album.” Decibel Magazine said, “Woe strive for sophistication without falling into the usual pitfalls of pretentiousness, cartoonish-ness or undue gloss. Essential aggression is maintained, while the atmospheric and emotional depth envelopes are pushed with a bold fearlessness.”

Last week has been hectic here in Montreal with student protests every single night, most of them. For those of you out there who called us “spoiled brats who want everything for free” let me remind you this : Here in Quebec we pay AT LEAST 40% income tax, I wonder what reaction that would get from the Tea Party. Anyways… Like a lot of young, urban (?!?) people, I watched it online live from CUTV (as my daughter was asleep) and I would like to thank them for the coverage since I couldn’t be there myself.
Best wishes for your continued success.

The night began with what had been introduced as each third year film student describing themselves through film in 10 seconds. These may actually be my favourite part of the evening. There were Pokémon references, memes, Final Cut and rendering frustrations, and a lot of endearing moments that helped get to know the students.

I hung up the phone and snuggled under the sheet, looking through the mosquito net that made the orange ambient street light streaming through the window fuzzy.

Brake seem to want to teach kids that it's alright to just walk out into the road because they will have successfully removed cars from the equation. Brake was founded after a truck with dodgy brakes killed the founders mother. I am human enough to sympathise with that, I think any decent person would be but they've lost all perspective on the real World. Had they just been a group that focused on car safety improvements, I'd have no issue with them. As it is, they've taken their extreme views to an almost Biblical level, and you all know what I think to the Bible.
This week over on Nutshells we have another great challenge for you all. This time we are asked to do a card using polka dots and/or stripes. It was great fun.

It is one of my first from them but I love her she makes me think of a retro, hip gal. I hope you all can join us this week.

Since yesterday was Thanksgiving, I thought I’d share recipes for the things I made that I’ve not posted before. We had a couple of repeats this year, including Apple Stuffing and Pecan Pie. But the rest of the meal was made on our Traeger. It was a little rainy, but my husband just pulled it under the eave a bit with just the smoke stack sticking out and it worked great.
Smooth and flavourful, with a touch of sweetness and a very crisp, zesty, bitter finish. Clean, well-balanced and altogether rather lovely. This cocktail had a textbook Negroni bitterness with a long, long finish.

Born Virginia Hensley and referred to by her family as “Ginny”, Patsy Cline displayed a talent for performing as early as the age of 4, when she won first prize in an amateur tap-dancing contest. It was not long afterward that she transferred her enthusiasm from dance to music, and for her eighth birthday Ginny’s mother bought a piano to provide her with a means to develop her natural musical skills. By her early teens she was singing in the choir of the family’s Baptist church and on her own at the local radio station. At the age of 13 the young girl’s life was nearly brought to end by an attack of rheumatic fever, which forced her to spend a period in an oxygen tent; she would later attribute the quality of her voice to the throat infection that resulted from her illness. Two years later her father abandoned the family and Ginny was forced to drop out of school, taking night jobs singing at clubs in addition to service jobs during the day in order to help pay the bills.

When my children are very young, they are not always able to understand and consider my needs. The friendships may look lopsided, just as some of my adult friendships do when one of us is going through difficult times. But I trust that if my children grow up being treated like my friends, they will know how to be friends. I look forward to great friendships with both of them. A war involves hostages. In some parent-child relationships, the child is almost like a hostage. But friendship does not involve hostages.

But the more I thought about it, the less the story hung together:
As with most right wing thinking, austerity is born from a lack of thought. It is a simple fact that cutting services means fewer jobs and raising taxes means people are worse off. The more unemployed you have the greater the drain on the economy, as the Government has to pay benefits but receive no taxes. The unemployment benefit is so laughable that people on it can’t usually spend anything outside of the basics, and so the economy loses out on sales, and the government loses out on VAT. Next, because the media constantly tells us we are in recession again, those people with jobs save their money. When they don’t spend, the shops lose out and in the worst cases have to enter insolvency, thus throwing another group of people out into unemployment. Cut, paste, repeat.

Even the littlest thing or ten minutes at a time can bring you closer to your goals.

Yes, you might be a prisoner of the Germans, but if that German officer is senior in rank to you, then you salute him. That is the British way.

This lasted for a few moments before she came back to her senses. She then pulled her coat around her and stood to leave. The pigeon hopped politely to one side. She hadn't even noticed me. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, people rarely do. My teeth ground together as I felt the anger rising in me. I watched her leave, and made a split second decision to head after her. I hung back a bit, I didn't want her to notice me now. Not yet anyway.

The abdominals weaken and lengthen during pregnancy, and I’m specifically talking about the six-pack muscle which runs from your breastbone, to your pubic bone, vertically down the front of your stomach. Sometimes these muscles separate, but not in all pregnancies. The deep, internal abdominal muscle called the Transverse Abdominis, sometimes referred to as your “core” muscle should be your main focus. Sit ups aren’t suitable for postnatal women to do, so stop them immediately if you are, and neither are forceful rotational movements where you twist your torso from right to left. It’s safer to perform Pilates-based exercises which target the pelvic floor and deep abdominal muscles or “core”, as these help stabilise your pelvis and the exercises themselves have numerous benefits.
I think their orientation was changing. We were really into Tweez, we were totally obsessed with that record. When Spiderland came out, a bunch of us said, "oh, well, I don't know about this..."

And they did that when they were 20? They were really young when they did that.

A couple of evenings ago I watched a documentary on TV about Tony Onley. I was inspired by something that Jack Shadbolt said. It was not his words per se but the cultural attitude that he and Onley had about ‘art’ last century – specifically painting. I mused that it would be so fun if there was a daily TV show on interviewing eclectic people about art. Some interviewees could be ‘experts’ – professors of art history, painting, art criticism; some gallery owners, curators, jurists; practitioners of contemporary art; or art collectors of all stripes. Others could include exhibition opening visitors and supporters, those who have never been to a gallery or artists discussing various topics including directions in their current work. Let’s get back the passion people. Onley, Shadbolt, Wyman and others discussed painting with enthusiasm.

But the way how I produce my songs is basically the same: Sitting in my room, dim light, a computer and a synthesizer, some chocolate, three cats and a night that becomes a day.

Democrats delivered for unions by exempting the first $27,500 of a straight family’s health plan from the “Cadillac tax” and delayed any taxation on those benefits until 2018. Gay individuals, parents and their children who receive their health insurance through their domestic partners pay income tax on dollar one of their benefits. This is a huge disparity in the treatment of gays and straights. It is also a hardship for middle and low-income gay families and an injustice for all gays. Lobbying to include domestic partners in the “Cadillac tax” exemption would have been smart, non-controversial and helped many in our community. Instead of making progress, by ignoring this opportunity we were left with the expansion of a discriminatory system.

This test will be of individual words and non-words. Pupils will be asked to show that they can offer the correct readings for the real words and plausible readings for the non-words ie pronouncing the letters and letter-combinations with the sounds that the children have been taught. So, for example a non-word with the 'ou' letters in the middle could be pronounced either as 'ou' in 'sound' or as 'ou' in 'wound' (as in 'hurt') (all southern English pronunciations). Whether they could pronounce it as the 'ou' in 'touch' is, I think, unlikely. We shall see whether 'rare' pronunciations will be allowed when the actual test comes out.

The platformer is a very old type of game, it’s been around since the days of arcade games like Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong. It was the king of consoles during the 8, 16, and 64-bit generations, and included some of gaming’s former greats like Sonic the Hedgehog, Spyro The Dragon, and Banjo-Kazooie. Traditionally, it’s been the Mario franchise that’s defined the next step for platformers. Super Mario Bros., Super Mario 64, and Super Mario Galaxy all defined the standards for the genre, but this time it’s different. This time the game that is setting the new standard is Miegakure, developed by Marc ten Bosch.

I believe that the goal should change from making children happy and protecting them from harm to raising them to be independent adults able to problem-solve and cope in the real and sometimes difficult adult world. A safety net can become a trap. Dependence on one’s parents means lack of real security and often results in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It's nonsense. Someone has written another book about how kids these days never grow up, and how it's all the parents' fault for being too helpful, too involved, too available. Read more about it here. Apparently, parents need to set more boundaries, have higher expectations, force independence at a younger age. The goal of parenting should be independence instead of happiness?! Dependence leads to low self-esteem?! Security makes us feel insecure?! I disagree.

Dad said nothing. He put the tree to the side of the house and went off again to find another one. This went ahead every year. Dad would find a tree and bring it back for Mom’s approval. It usually took three or four attempts before Mom decided she liked the first one best. Dad would then strip some boughs from the others before putting them on the wood pile. He bored holes in the trunk of the Christmas tree and inserted the extra boughs to fill it out.

There is also a photograph of a man standing at a press table in the middle of an empty arena, his hand covering his face in expressionistic gesture. This man seems like discoursing minister, full of pomp and rhetoric, and what occurs here is quite interesting. Does Pfeiffer suggest that signifiers of video and spectacle inducing media cover up feelings in society that seem to be much like old fashion worship? Are basketball players and media figures our temporary gods, replaced each night by new symbols? There is pessimism at work here.
Just… and his PLAN is ever revealing, ever satisfying and may I say ever so Perfect.
In the top picture, I feel Vanessa Hudgens rocks her double denim look ONLY because the shorts she is wearing are black. Wearing double denim the SAME SHADE looks crappy (in my opinion of course).

Finally, on this Thanksgiving 2010, I hope you all had a great day with family and feasting. One of the things I am thankful for is that fine folks like you stop by here now and then.
What I really loved about this recipe though is that you prepare it the night before and it's all ready to go the next morning. Brilliant! I adore waffles on the weekend but sometimes I just want to sit with my coffee and relax rather than make a big breakfast. It was so nice to plug in the waffle iron and have a steamy hot fluffy waffle on my plate a few minutes later. Love this and will definitely make again!
The incident has raised concerns for the medical-marijuana community in California, particularly the Harborside Health Center, a regulated dispensary also based in Oakland, which also happens to be the largest in the World. Harborside has had various threats from the IRS over the last two years regarding its business conduct, documented in ‘Weed Wars’, a program broadcast on the Discovery Channel. Assessing the situation from afar it seems noticeable that the authorities chose to attack the university (instead of just a dispensary) – perhaps because of their free licence to spread information on private production of cannabis and profiteering as a business, rather than just selling and distributing the drug. To try and determine the objectives of the authorities and federal agents who organised the raid, their concern on this front seems more understandable; the desire to exercise their power and eliminate personal usage whilst discrediting the facts and existing information.

2. We wanted a subtle gradation with the fuchsia so there was no hard line where the blonde ends and the pink begins. Using a semi-permanent pink color + warm water we created 3 different strength pinks in 3 different bowls. (We used Special FX color in Atomic Pink. Put 2 quarter sized dabs of color in each bowl. Add 1/2 a cup of warm water to one bowl, 1 cup of warm water to the second bowl and 1 1/2 cups of warm water to the third bowl.)

I have a new friend. I'll call him Adrian. Hello, Adrian - I'm sure you will recognise yourself, even with this different name. Adrian has written a long novel which he has been working on for much of this year. He has had feedback from several readers, some with publishing industry experience, so their comments are more likely to be useful than those of random friends and family. He has taken on board all their comments and made changes to his novel. I have not read his novel, nor do I intend to until it is published. I have read and commented on the synopsis and the first page - that's all. So can I be any use to Adrian in helping him develop his novel? I think so. Because I don't think I can teach him to write, but I might be able to help him to learn to write.

He would win true acclaim and popularity, however, as the city's district attorney proper, serving first from 1853-1859 and again from 1861-1869, one of New York's most important legal voices during the Civil War. He allegedly prosecuted over 12,000 cases. He was also on hand during the Draft Riots, funneling many rioters through the court system and straight to jail. His accomplice was often judge John Hoffman, soon to be the mayor of New York who preceded Hall. Their crusades against rioters would boost both their popularity.

I like to listen to Dave Ramsey. I find him to be very encouraging, not only about money, but about life in general. I’d also like to change my view, my family history of money. I don’t want to think of myself as poor. Just because my parents were in debt, and their parents before them, even if they weren’t in debt, were at least very poor, doesn’t have to mean that I can’t be successful financially in my life.

Given that the film is all about singing, there is of course a litany of catchy tunes waiting to infect your hind brain and refuse to leave for days and weeks to come. Scarily enough, most of them sounded like Lily Allen’s ‘Not Fair’. Sitting watching a kids’ film whilst a song about premature ejaculation plays over and over in your head is a surreal experience to say the least. And not one I would care to repeat.
Consider your make-up when purchasing a red cocktail dress. Uncover a shade of lipstick and blush that enhances your gown rather than matching it just. Stop buyer's remorse by attempting around the cocktail dress using your heels and accessories while in the shop. Shell out near focus for your hair, eye shade and system kind; invest in a dress that not just flatters your figure but matches your skin tone superbly.
The kicker (HAHA I MAKE FUNNY PUN) is that he was about to leave for lunch but before he left he took Kaiser out back to use the restroom. While he was standing out there waiting the line exploded and took his grizzled old ass out. He handled it like a boss while he waited for the squad to arrive and I'm sure it didn't feel real good.

Funny: As a kid I had always thought National League baseball was kind of boring. I mean, you give me a choice to watch Rico Carty wind his bat and glare down a pitcher or watch Buzz Capra bunt … that was no contest for me.

This test will be of individual words and non-words. Pupils will be asked to show that they can offer the correct readings for the real words and plausible readings for the non-words ie pronouncing the letters and letter-combinations with the sounds that the children have been taught. So, for example a non-word with the 'ou' letters in the middle could be pronounced either as 'ou' in 'sound' or as 'ou' in 'wound' (as in 'hurt') (all southern English pronunciations). Whether they could pronounce it as the 'ou' in 'touch' is, I think, unlikely. We shall see whether 'rare' pronunciations will be allowed when the actual test comes out.

I think their orientation was changing. We were really into Tweez, we were totally obsessed with that record. When Spiderland came out, a bunch of us said, "oh, well, I don't know about this..." That's pretty well stood the test of time. I've heard that record a few too many times, for sure, but side one of that you can't even touch. It's just really spectacular. And they did that when they were 20? They were really young when they did that.

I also know how hard you worked for the money that you invested to receive publishing and promotional services that you expected to be provided—especially when I promised you that the work you paid for would be done. At the time I sold you these services, I truly believed that you were paying for legitimate services that were being provided by the owners of the company. When I realized this wasn’t the case, I made the decision to leave.

Born Virginia Hensley and referred to by her family as “Ginny”, Patsy Cline displayed a talent for performing as early as the age of 4, when she won first prize in an amateur tap-dancing contest. It was not long afterward that she transferred her enthusiasm from dance to music, and for her eighth birthday Ginny’s mother bought a piano to provide her with a means to develop her natural musical skills. By her early teens she was singing in the choir of the family’s Baptist church and on her own at the local radio station. At the age of 13 the young girl’s life was nearly brought to end by an attack of rheumatic fever, which forced her to spend a period in an oxygen tent; she would later attribute the quality of her voice to the throat infection that resulted from her illness. Two years later her father abandoned the family and Ginny was forced to drop out of school, taking night jobs singing at clubs in addition to service jobs during the day in order to help pay the bills.

I love making images that show the environment at weddings. I think this image of Loc and Sadie's ceremony from a distance during the storm is just amazing. It says so much about them and the love their friends and family have for them. Loc and Sadie's closest family and friends stood steady in the storm, freezing (my hands froze up) and getting soaked to the bones to show their support. I know that as years pass the spiritual connection to this spot on the hillside will grow not only for Loc and Sadie, but for all who were there.

Brake seem to want to teach kids that it's alright to just walk out into the road because they will have successfully removed cars from the equation. Brake was founded after a truck with dodgy brakes killed the founders mother. I am human enough to sympathise with that, I think any decent person would be but they've lost all perspective on the real World. Had they just been a group that focused on car safety improvements, I'd have no issue with them. As it is, they've taken their extreme views to an almost Biblical level, and you all know what I think to the Bible.
A.: I wouldn’t say I write like he did, especially since he is one of the greatest writers of my generation, but my favorite author of recent years has been David Foster Wallace. I think I share with him a respect for rather than a loathing of popular culture, and it seeps into everything I write. Like Wallace, I prefer to stretch and to challenge readers rather than ever to underestimate them and “write down” to them. In YA, I’m especially fond of John Green, David Levithan, and Jay Asher. In practical terms and like so many others, Stephen King’s On Writing has been profoundly influential in my work. I never start a new project without reading it.

I got 8 cups of juice and stuck that in the freezer.

There are a few tactics used to gain subscribers. Some sites hit you with a popup as soon as you come to it, asking you to subscribe. I for one abhor these popups (to spite claims they work), because if I haven’t even read your content yet, no way am I going to start handing you my information (even tho I am sure you will respect all my privacy). Some people put content plugs in their material for subscribers (it is on the right, it says “Follow the madness.”). But I have my doubts shameless plugs will do it either.

I used to envy my younger brother at these times and for a number of reasons. The first being that as he always received his belting second, my dads efforts would be significantly less, having already tired out his swinging arm on me. The second, for some reason no matter how hard the punishment was and how much yelling was going on, my brother had a habit of laughing uncontrollably throughout the whole thing. I now realise that this was probably a nervous laughter, coming out of fear but at the time I just wished that I could have seen even a fracture of the humour I perceived that he was seeing. The third and probably the most valid, my brother was a naughty child, he did do things that were nasty and horrible and inexplicable. He showed no fear in his actions and if he thought something seemed like a good idea at the time, he did it. I envied the fact that even though he was being punished for his actions, at least he had the benefit of having done what he wanted and had fun doing it.

Hola from Peru! We are the May Peru trip leaders Jess and Holly. We have had an incredible first few days and are excited to have started placements. We have had the wonderful opportunity of being able to watch the participants experience new relationships, new opportunities, and immerse themselves in the Peruvian culture. This week we are working on the construction of a daycare in Pacifico de Villa, as well as assisting at Laura Alva Saldana; a school for children with exceptionalities, and teaching English to children at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey schools. I (Jess) have been working at Laura Alva Saldana with four participants, where I would assist them with communicating with the teachers and students. While I (Holly) have been working at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey, assisting participants as they teach children English at the primary and secondary level. We would like to turn it over to a few of our participants, as they will be sharing some of their experiences this week. We encourage you to follow along with us on our amazing journey.
The immortal Buster Keaton once said that tragedy is a close-up; comedy, a long shot. Horace Walpole put it in another perspective when he wrote that, “Life is a comedy for those who think…and a tragedy for those who feel.” Both of these great men were correct. Perspective is everything in life. If someone slips on a banana-peel and pratfalls, it might be funny to those nearby. But I guarantee you that the person who fell will have a very different opinion on the matter. Humor and tragedy are polarizing issues in that they represent opposite sides of the same coin. Most films try to pick one interpretation of their events and run with it, resulting in traditional comedies and dramas. But there are the rare occasions when filmmakers embrace both perspectives, reveling in both the intrinsic drama and absurdity of their plots. These are the black comedies.
The annual Nude campaign that Marie Claire has grown quite famous for over the years, wherein a handful of cause-inspired, famous South Africans in the fields of entertainment and business amongst others, communicate their ideologies so bravely, in support of the notion of respect for the human (and animal) entity – with a mega focus on the body, raising deep rooted issues, funds and ultimately, AWARENESS.

And so we began at the scene of battle. A number of kobold corpses lay scattered about the ruined well house. One of the kobolds was still gasping for air, and makes the mistake of trying to mock the heroes for their fruitless search for Ronnick, the villain of the story. The kobold spits out a mouthful of blood and broken teeth before giggling maniacally and shouting “Ha, you took the bait! Now Ronnick can make it to his real hide out at Dragontooth Hill.” After a pause, the kobold realizes he gave away important information, but it is too late. He is tied up, interrogated, and finally, a magic missile by Faverel puts an end to his torment. As the kobold perishes with a smoking hole in his forehead, he shrugs and has one last gem of wisdom to offer. “Oh well, I had it coming.”
"It could only happen on Top Of The Pops - it's classical guitar" If you like, Jimmy. "Where could you get such class except Top Of The Pops?" rhetorically asks a man who chose to dress like that. Both parties sit, the crowd stand pensively around the perimeter of a small circular stage I don't think we've ever seen before. It's pretty much what you'd expect Feelings performed by Cleo Laine with John Williams to sound like, a reminder that throughout this decade you'd get stuff well out of the pop loop - the Shadows were regulars well into the 80s - in an attempt to paint the show as inclusive and classy. The response is appropriately Two Ronnies audience-like.

Net result? Most computer programmers are guys. Not because they’re naturally more talented at it, and not even (entirely) because there are sexist barriers to entry to that field, but because when this generation of girls was ten years old, they were told by the media that tech is a boys’ world, and that the world to which they should aspire centers around housekeeping, looking pretty and breeding. Even if no one else in her life told her she couldn’t be a programmer, she’s unlikely to pursue that career because not enough people told her she could.

Discipline in schools is important to ensure a positive learning environment for all. I think clear, applicable, and relevant policies outlining behaviors and consequences is one way to ensure students and teachers feel safe to learn.

Discipline in schools is important to ensure a positive learning environment for all. I think clear, applicable, and relevant policies outlining behaviors and consequences is one way to ensure students and teachers feel safe to learn.

Relationships: Whoever you are, you need a support system. Relationships are vital to your health. You need to lovingly weed those negative people out of your garden. Negativity is toxic. If you are eating raw organic vegan and jogging ten miles, and then going home and being verbally abused, your health is still going to suffer. Everyone has a responsibility to take care of her own garden. Bless those negative people and love yourself enough to extract yourself from that situation. If you need help, get it.

On the other hand, there are those that spend an enormous amount of time in the boss’s office. Perched on the edge of their chair, a basket of freshly made muffins and a smile that even Colgate would question. They hang on every word from their beloved leaders’ mouth and pretend like they know what the heck is going on. This, my friend, is a brown noser in the making. Their competence level is strained at best, and they were hired for looks, connections or rate of speech (yes, even novices how to strategically land a job by fast talking their way into the hearts of the decision makers). I used to say this to my oldest as he was growing up. Feel free to use it. Your face will get you in the door; your heart will keep you. I’d modify that slightly for this blog – Your face will get you in the door; your talent will keep you.

For the image panel, I've chosen the "Bells and Boughs" stamp set from Stampin' Up. I love the vintage look of these stamps. The image was colored with Cherry Cobbler, Garden Green and Hansome Hunter inkpads using a Dove blender pen. A bit of Mustard color ink was used to outline the image and make it pop. The panel was distressed using Tea Dye and Old Paper distress ink from Tim Holtz. A bit of yellow stickles to highlight the flower centers and a few silver rhinestone embellishments and that's it.
The country that we love already exists; it's here, all around us. Fighting to keep something, to preserve our Constitution and our great nation, is far easier than fighting to take something away, to destroy and obliterate it. We have will, determination, American pride and ingenuity. We are the ones who thoroughly, to our marrow, understand the phrase "Give me liberty or give me death." This love of country, this patriotism, is not something you learn in a book, it's not something you ponder out of the ether while standing around in ice-cream coats and munching on fancy herring snacks. It is deep, it is enduring--it lives in us and is who we are.

This lasted for a few moments before she came back to her senses. She then pulled her coat around her and stood to leave. The pigeon hopped politely to one side. She hadn't even noticed me. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, people rarely do. My teeth ground together as I felt the anger rising in me. I watched her leave, and made a split second decision to head after her. I hung back a bit, I didn't want her to notice me now. Not yet anyway.
I mean, you don't have to be a rocket scientist. You can't make this shit up. My son was labeled autistic when he was 3 years old. The ONLY expert I listened to was Temple Grandin.

Endings. Again, like The House of the Devil - which I'm constantly comparing to as it's such an awesome movie - The Innkeepers somewhat challenges its audience. Did it really happen? I know of people who read the ending of The House of the Devil as a possible “dream state/imaginary” space as to say that the movie never really happened… strange yes, and I do not really agree with it either, but at the same time, I definitely feel that The Innkeepers does pose similar questions. Did it really happen or was it in the state of fear and confusion that brought it all on? The last shot lingers on for an eternity before presenting the answer. And I also find that last scene to be part of the intelligent narrative that West uses in The Innkeepers. It's not to unlike the viral video that was seen earlier. He builds to a climax with the exact same tricks that the viral video does. And this is a motif that I find runs vibrantly though the movie. Is it real or all just a trick? During the last half hour, I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a scene where Claire wakes up and it all had been a dream. Now this doesn’t happen obviously, but in some strange way there’s a feeling that it could have happened in the last act.

What happens when an ‘extremist’ organisation is banned? Some - or even lots - of its member and supporters become angry and disaffected about the denial of their democratic right to be a member of a non-violent organisation. It the EDL case it is an organisation whose literature does not actually contain a single word that can justifiably be deemed as extreme. The EDL can only be deemed extreme if you look at it through the lense of Marxist theory in which any criticism of an 'oppressed group' is by definition both 'fascist' and 'racist'.
Rudyard Kipling achieved fame quickly, based initially on his first stories and poems written in India (he returned there after College), and his great popularity with the British public continued despite subsequent critical reaction to some of his more conservative work, and critical opinion in later years that his poetry was superficial and lacking in depth of meaning.

Even if the flute gets the spotlight for most of the time, TAAB2 is still a progressive rock album at its core. The songs are very well glued together, complex and intricate. Overshadowed by the flute as they might be, the guitars still sound pretty bad ass and the drumming is top notch. Because Ian’s voice is not as good as it was in his youth, he turned to a more mellow, low tone pitched delivery and, frankly, that’s a good thing; it blends very well with the album, and it proves that Ian is the kind of artist that is very aware of his limits and writes his songs accordingly. He hasn’t turned soft, if that’s what you’re thinking, nor has his music suffered a decline in quality – it’s just a tad different from what he used to do and it suits him well.

One of the things I love about the human heart is that it’s wired to help others when they’re in need. I see this repeated over and over: when a natural disaster strikes a town, or when a terrible wrong is committed against someone who’s done right, or when a beloved friend passes away. When people see a need, they often respond with caring hearts.

William was about to get in when a woman parked next to us rolled down her window. “Excuse me,” she said, “I just wanted to let you know that we’ve been praying for you!” She had never met us, only recognized us from the blog, yet boldly decided to speak out. By doing so she completely made our day! We had permanent smiles etched on our faces at yet another example of just how many lives little Nora has touched. Thank you, Jennifer for your courage in saying something to us and for praying for us! That was awesome!

A ruler always makes sure the elite class is on his side. The personnel selection system is often used as a way for the emperor to share power with the elite class and thus consolidate the base of their legitimacy. From a society in which social position and political power were based largely on kinship credentials, China was transformed into a meritocracy in which social prestige and political appointment depended mostly on classical examinations to establish legitimate academic credentials (Elman, 1989). For the emperor, producing talented and loyal officials for the state to employ had been the prime concern. Also, by spreading the chances of participating in politics among the masses regardless of their family backgrounds, the emperor promulgated a feeling of equality and empowerment of the poor.
In my 2009 Brew Year Goals post, I explained that I wanted to try growing some hops this year. I have been doing some research and making a list of potential varieties based on my taste in beer. I was talking with SWMBO about which ones I should try. She asked how much they were. I told her I was looking at freshops.com who had them at $4.50 each. She thought for a moment and said, “Why don’t you just get them all?” Before she could change her mind, I had the order placed. That was March 1. They were shipped March 4 and arrived here March 6. Now they are in the refrigerator waiting for the risk of frost to pass.

Net result? Most computer programmers are guys. Not because they’re naturally more talented at it, and not even (entirely) because there are sexist barriers to entry to that field, but because when this generation of girls was ten years old, they were told by the media that tech is a boys’ world, and that the world to which they should aspire centers around housekeeping, looking pretty and breeding. Even if no one else in her life told her she couldn’t be a programmer, she’s unlikely to pursue that career because not enough people told her she could.

There are a few items that you can always count on me being stocked up on. Pasta and chicken just happen to be two of those items. I threw this recipe together after seeing a similar recipe on allrecipes.com. It was surprisingly good, both Daniel and I had seconds. I've never used pesto before and after a mis-communication between Daniel and I last fall, he brought me home three jars of the stuff. I requested three jars of brushcetta, still not sure why he then brought home pesto but all is good. I contemplated adding some cream cheese to the pesto sauce, but I was afraid it wouldn't turn out so I left it out. If someone is brave enough to add the cream cheese please let me know how it turns out!

Sport brings about a whole new meaning behind the value of food! I would argue that as an athlete, the preparation and consumption of food can take up to half of our entire day. I have come to appreciate the value that proper nutrition can have on body composition, performance and confidence. Two years ago, I weighed in at a rather staggering amount. I was boggled by the continual growth (bad kind of growth) on the scale week after week as I felt that my diet had an awful lot of spinach and not enough ice-cream. In September 2010, I was about 20 pounds heavier than what I targeted my ideal racing weight to be. Imagine skating, sliding, jumping, running, simply living with a 20lb sac of potatoes on your back – kinda’ an inconvenience. So with this thought in mind (and motivated by the fact that my cyclist brother (4” taller than me) weighed the same) I was determined to figure out how to mash this sac of potatoes and become a healthy, lean machine.
Also, I know that a couple of people asked me to keep them posted on how the zine was going, so I'll give a litle update on that! About 30 people have said they will, or probably will, contribute to the zine, which is really exciting! I've actually received 5 different things from 3 different people, and am hoping to get more stuff soon... ;-) So that's going well.
Every era had its styles and often times they were copied from others. So, over time, old European cities become a clutter of styles and shapes. But nobody really wants to go back to very old tastes. I doubt anybody would prefer candles and oil lamps over electric lights. And we can't really function now without good office buildings. Private homes are another matter but I doubt anyone really wants to live in a mud brick hut rather than a modern house.

I was reading a thriller the other day, one of those convoluted stories with a dozen endings as if the author couldn’t figure out which ending he wanted to use. There were three crimes, all dealing with the same group of people yet none of the crimes were related. One of the crimes was a kidnapping, and though I know who did the kidnapping, the story was so complicated I still don’t know who instigated it. Despite all the flaws of the book, the one thing that took me out of the story was a typo. The author tried to set the scene using smells — the aroma of an expensive cigar, the smell of leather chairs, the scent of Channel Number 5 lingering in the air.

I think their orientation was changing. We were really into Tweez, we were totally obsessed with that record. When Spiderland came out, a bunch of us said, "oh, well, I don't know about this..." That's pretty well stood the test of time. I've heard that record a few too many times, for sure, but side one of that you can't even touch. It's just really spectacular. And they did that when they were 20? They were really young when they did that.

Relationships: Whoever you are, you need a support system. Relationships are vital to your health. You need to lovingly weed those negative people out of your garden. Negativity is toxic. If you are eating raw organic vegan and jogging ten miles, and then going home and being verbally abused, your health is still going to suffer. Everyone has a responsibility to take care of her own garden. Bless those negative people and love yourself enough to extract yourself from that situation. If you need help, get it.

A couple of weeks ago my writing took a bit of a blow; having had a spectacular start to the masters course with A+ grades and general good feelings about my work coming from most angles, I decided to take some risks with my subject matter and style. I thought I had stepped up my game, I felt my prose had taken on a poetic aspect and I was writing the strange, macabre tales I would love to read. But, without any prior notice, my grade dropped rather significantly. Perhaps the risks were a mistake, or perhaps the process of marking creative writing will always be a subjective practice no matter how greatly objectivity is pursued. Either way I didn’t take the criticism very well. I called my friends who met me immediately in the pub for five hours of Articulate (possibly the best board game ever) and copious amounts of cloudy cider. Hugging the toilet bowl the following morning, a promise I had made myself a few years ago not to turn to alcohol in times of rejection/massive self-pity resurfaced. A little too late maybe, but I reaffirmed it that day all the same.

There are a few tactics used to gain subscribers. Some sites hit you with a popup as soon as you come to it, asking you to subscribe. I for one abhor these popups (to spite claims they work), because if I haven’t even read your content yet, no way am I going to start handing you my information (even tho I am sure you will respect all my privacy). Some people put content plugs in their material for subscribers (it is on the right, it says “Follow the madness.”). But I have my doubts shameless plugs will do it either.

But then, we hit the kicker--tort liability and the potential undermining of the First Amendment. We've already seen several high profile libel cases in recent years. Remember Carol Burnett v The National Enquirer, Inc? This was a landmark case, especially for celebrities, who had been spectacularly unsuccessful in libel cases prior to this. What made the case so important was the court's determination that the Enquirer had employed "actual malice" and that, because they didn't comply with the California regulations for newspapers, and as thus were liable for punitive damages despite the retraction they'd printed. After some pretty strenuous searching on my part, I haven't found any undermining of the First Amendment due to this tort liability. (I have, however, noticed that the National Enquirer has been tippy-toeing in its claims about celebrities since.)

“Unlike you” – Evans was speaking to one who only half heard him – “I like to live with my treasures. To-night I’ve dined with Schalcken and his little girl. One picture is sufficient for a room; at the most four. The rest should be hung in a gallery. When I am likely to be away from home for any length of time, I take a picture with me. When I return, I know that picture. If I were an artist, I could reproduce every line of it.”

A wide covered porch off the living room steps down to a semi-circular stone terrace with direct view of the reservoir through a narrow cut in the thick stand of trees along the shore.

Moore says building strategic partnerships enables companies to work through challenging markets and fast-track overall success. “As a CEO, I see it as part of my job to be a super connector, networking with the technology and investment community without an expectation of reciprocation. Partnerships forged through time, trust, and mutual benefit–such as those Axcient has built with HP, Ingram-Micro, and a vast network of service providers and resellers–are the types of community relationships that bring about the greatest returns.”
I believe that the goal should change from making children happy and protecting them from harm to raising them to be independent adults able to problem-solve and cope in the real and sometimes difficult adult world. A safety net can become a trap. Dependence on one’s parents means lack of real security and often results in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It's nonsense. Someone has written another book about how kids these days never grow up, and how it's all the parents' fault for being too helpful, too involved, too available. Read more about it here. Apparently, parents need to set more boundaries, have higher expectations, force independence at a younger age. The goal of parenting should be independence instead of happiness?! Dependence leads to low self-esteem?! Security makes us feel insecure?! I disagree.

Rudyard Kipling achieved fame quickly, based initially on his first stories and poems written in India (he returned there after College), and his great popularity with the British public continued despite subsequent critical reaction to some of his more conservative work, and critical opinion in later years that his poetry was superficial and lacking in depth of meaning.

If the drunk driver was not at a bar or other business that serves alcohol before the crash, there is still the possibility of filing a claim through auto insurance. And in many cases, the drunk driver will also be punished in a criminal court. Although being found guilty for criminal charges can increase the likelihood of a civil personal injury case succeeding, you may still need the help of a drunk driving accident injury lawyer to deal with adjusters and use all the evidence correctly.

If violent video games were the cause for aggression in school, then there would be far more violence than we are seeing today. The truth is, despite all of the lobbying to get parental warnings on video games, the number one sellers for each year are always first person shooters. So why are we seeing an increase in emotional support schools and not an increase in violent behaviors associated with these graphic games? The answer shouldn’t surprise you. We have effectively misplaced our direction to focus on the outward sources rather than the inward struggle.

You may ask, then, why I have chosen a ball perched atop a steep hill to represent the very foundation of contemporary society. I make no claims of any great knowledge in neurology, psychology, anthropology, or sociology, but there is one characteristic of our society that my own observations have repeatedly led me to: this hill, this very foundation, is unstable. At any point, a small amount of force applied in the right direction can start the ball rolling back down, back to stable ground, to the agrarian, community-based economics practiced for so much of human history. A small shift in day-to-day life, or the rediscovery of a older, simpler tradition that, in the hustle and bustle of modern life, we didn’t realize we had forgotten – these little events on a societal or, more likely, personal level, can start the ball rolling. Moreover, if strong enough, they can completely derail all of the artificiality, materialism, and vice which have been forced upon us (by whom?: that is a whole discussion in itself), in order to separate us from our roots and keep us in a state of near-subservience.

Direct taxation has been reduced for the super-rich, and there has been a rise in the general tax allowance. Isn't allowance an interesting word? Yes, the Establishment have decided that we are 'allowed' to keep a little more of our own money; brazenly stating that they have control over our money! This rise in the untaxed 'allowance' is immediately wiped out by a massive rise in the cost of petrol and diesel. In the topsy-turvy UK, there are no measures to discourage employers employing people not living locally, so commuting is a fact of life for most people. The increase in fuel 'duty' (again, an interesting word!) simply transfers the money not stolen by direct taxation, to theft by indirect taxation. Considering the cost of fuel, the result of the two measures is to rob the people of more of our money, whilst appearing to take less. To emphasise this theft, fuel duty increases this week, but the tax allowance does not rise for a full twelve months.

A couple of evenings ago I watched a documentary on TV about Tony Onley. I was inspired by something that Jack Shadbolt said. It was not his words per se but the cultural attitude that he and Onley had about ‘art’ last century – specifically painting. I mused that it would be so fun if there was a daily TV show on interviewing eclectic people about art. Some interviewees could be ‘experts’ – professors of art history, painting, art criticism; some gallery owners, curators, jurists; practitioners of contemporary art; or art collectors of all stripes. Others could include exhibition opening visitors and supporters, those who have never been to a gallery or artists discussing various topics including directions in their current work. Let’s get back the passion people. Onley, Shadbolt, Wyman and others discussed painting with enthusiasm.

I believe that the goal should change from making children happy and protecting them from harm to raising them to be independent adults able to problem-solve and cope in the real and sometimes difficult adult world. A safety net can become a trap. Dependence on one’s parents means lack of real security and often results in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It's nonsense. Someone has written another book about how kids these days never grow up, and how it's all the parents' fault for being too helpful, too involved, too available. Read more about it here. Apparently, parents need to set more boundaries, have higher expectations, force independence at a younger age. The goal of parenting should be independence instead of happiness?! Dependence leads to low self-esteem?! Security makes us feel insecure?! I disagree.

Where previously the parameters of our societies would bind and keep us herded, we are in a rapid ‘out with the old, in with the new’ period. So a desire to implement sudden change or taking impulsive action will reign more than usually for a lot of people. You may experience nervousness with this new boldness, and uncertainty about your choices will be a mental symptom from time to time. But know that these symptoms are part of the journey of your deeper awakening. You are stepping away from the road well travelled, and onto the road your intelligent body (rather than your mind) wants you to walk.

For the image panel, I've chosen the "Bells and Boughs" stamp set from Stampin' Up. I love the vintage look of these stamps. The image was colored with Cherry Cobbler, Garden Green and Hansome Hunter inkpads using a Dove blender pen. A bit of Mustard color ink was used to outline the image and make it pop. The panel was distressed using Tea Dye and Old Paper distress ink from Tim Holtz. A bit of yellow stickles to highlight the flower centers and a few silver rhinestone embellishments and that's it.

Rea: Your first relationships are often the most intense and impressionable of your life. You’re not yet bombarded with paying bills or having a steady job – you can enjoy each other – you can focus on your feelings and not much else. As we grow older, this is what we often lose sight of: each other. This book reminds you of what’s important at any stage in relationships – focusing on what you appreciate about the person, not what annoys you.

That said, when I go back and think about how the film was edited, I’d be hard-pressed to say what I would add back in while keeping the violence level toned down — not a lot of gore in the film as opposed to the book — and the film at a reasonable length.

Since my Washington, D.C. address and the writing of this article, I conducted two vitally important pieces of research work on Dr. Bob and his younger years in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. First, my son and I visited St. Johnsbury, Vermont twice over a total period of three weeks. We were able to find literally thousands of relevant records, manuscripts, books, sermons, teachings, newspapers articles, and other writings that showed the immense Christian upbringing Dr. Bob had as a youngster in Vermont. His upbringing involved the Great Awakening of 1875 which preceded his birth but impacted on the entire community of St. Johnsbury. It involved his Congregationalist parents and their indoctrination of Bob with facts about salvation and the Word of God. It involved the North Congregational Church of St. Johnsbury, Vermont where the entire Smith family attended church services at least 4 times each week. The father was a Deacon, a member of the Executive Committee, and a Sunday school teacher. The mother helped write a history of the church, headed its Christian education program, sang in the choir, and was active in many church activities. The Young Men’s Christian Association, as well as the Young People’s Society of Christian Endeavor, played a major role in the church; and the YMCA, of which Bob’s father was President, was also active in St. Johnsbury Academy which Dr. Bob attended.

As unfortunate as it may be, Jonathan Lee’s documentary is my first foray into the eccentric and powerful world of Paul Goodman. Paul Goodman Changed My Life does little more than give a basic introduction into the background of Goodman. Lee doesn’t attempt to get into the psyche of Goodman, or to justify or vilify his actions, but instead Lee documents Goodman’s life to the best of his ability. The resulting effort leaves me – a newcomer to Goodman’s work – feeling like an outsider.

As with most studies, there are limitations to the data. The study focused on data from registries instead of actual ADHD patients. Data was collected for more than 150,000 individuals currently taking drugs such as Ritalin or Concerta. These persons were compared to 434,000 people who were not taking these medications. The researchers found that over 1,300 participants had a heart attack, stroke, or cardiac related death. However, the drugs were not an increased risk to the deaths. In addition, neither age nor a history of heart disease added risk to ADHD drug users. Researchers also found that the deaths were the same during the use of an ADHD drug and a year after use had ceased.

Going from relaxed to natural hair can be an exciting, liberating experience, and there are two basic ways to get there. The fastest, no nonsense way to go natural is by simply cutting off all the relaxed hair in one fell swoop, or big chopping. But big chopping can require a strength that not everyone is equipped with at the outset of a hair care journey. For some, deliberate transitioning (complete with mini chops) is a necessary part of the “back to natural” process. And, if we really look at it, everyone who makes the journey must transition. Whether you big chop on day one of your thought, or a year after the initial thought, transitioning always starts with the mind well before any actionable steps are taken. In some circles, however, transitioning— especially long term transitioning, is seen as a sign of weakness. I argue, quite the contrary!

It took a while for Greg, Robert and I to get into the dancing, although the drumming (provided by the amazing Bill Matthews and Friends) was highly infectious and could not be resisted for long. Greg and I were both moving to the rhythms, although not quite dancing during the early numbers. Robert was appreciative of the music but not moving too much early on. At some point during that first hour of music, one of the dancers, a lithe, lovely raven-haired vision in white lace, extended a graceful hand to me and drew me into the dance. From then on, for a total of around 3 hours, it was nearly non-stop dancing for me. Greg had started really dancing around this time too and never stopped.

But it’s through Elizabeth’s eyes that we can get a semblance of how these events affect her and her siblings. Elizabeth was a bright, young girl. She studied with the best professors and was often ages ahead of everybody else when it came to education. At the beginning of her life she was a doted upon child, who received every pleasure that her mother and father could provide to her. But with the death of her mother, she was rendered a bastard, and her titles taken away. No only that, but she was no longer given the care that she deserved and at one point in her young life was forced to go without clothing. She was in exile. Following Henry’s marriage to Catherine Parr, he reinstated her into his will, as the third successor to the throne, following Edward VI and her older sister Mary. This was a happy time in her life, she was the apple of her father’s eye, being so much like him. Her position in life was stable and she had good relationships with her siblings. But everything changed with the death of her father, and her brother Edward VI’s succession to the throne. It should be noted that during this time the new religion has held strong. The story of this period of Elizabeth’s life became much of a struggle revolving around religion. Her brother was Protestant, her sister Catholic. Both of their reigns were blemished with religious competition and the will to bring their religion to the people. Mary’s reign was very difficult for Elizatbeth, not only due to their religious differences but also due to Elizabeth’s involvement in plots against Mary. But finally following a series of maladies disguised as pregnancies to Mary, she died and Elizabeth was given the throne. There starts the reign of Elizabeth, one of the longest-serving Queens/Kings ever. She became the virgin Queen, to never marry, she became one of England’s greatest rulers. Commanding both respect and fear.

What the parties wanted to know was whether the exception for ephemeral recordings under copyright law also covered recordings made by legally independent external television production companies where those recordings were commissioned from them by DR or by TV2 Danmark for initial broadcast on DR or TV2 Danmark. According to DR and TV2 Danmark, it was irrelevant to copyright holders whether recordings for purposes of transmission were made by the staff of thea broadcasting organisation itself with its own equipment, or by an employee of a third company from which the broadcasting organisation commissioned the production, with that third company’s equipment. They also argued that there was no condition in Paragraph 31 of the Danish Law on Copyright to require broadcasting organisations to make recordings ‘by means of their own facilities’. Thus, under Danish law, it didn' tmatter, for the application of the exception concerning recordings for the purpose of transmission, whether those recordings were made by employees of the broadcasting organisation or by employees of third parties. NCB however argued that European Union law imposed a condition relating to production ‘by means of their own facilities’, this condition being applicable under the Danish Law on Copyright. The Østre Landsret (Eastern Regional Court) decided at this point that it was better to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling than to become increasingly baffled by these arguments.

For starters, no one is property, we are not owned by anyone. Second of all, women especially are not property. To me, that shows insecurity, and the fact that this kid said it the way he did, I think either he learned it from friends or his own dad. Plus, he crashed her car, she didn’t crash it, and yet he is telling her to ‘shut up’ which is the most uncalled for act he could have done besides referring to her as his ‘property.’ It wasn’t her fault, it was his, but the whole endeavor was just uncalled for

With a screenplay by Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel and Edward Bunker that was based on a script written by none other than Akira Kurosawa, Runaway Train aims to be the kind of mix of action-movie thrills, character study and philosophical discourse that Kurosawa often excelled at in his heyday. It thoroughly fulfills its first aim, with a handful of edge-of-your-seat stunts, action sequences and high-powered collisions to satisfy the popcorn crowd. As a character study, though, it's more problematic. Some of the dialogue is so ham-fisted in trying to explore its themes that it's almost a miracle that the actors manage to find imaginative ways to deliver it; on the other hand, some of that acting is just so mannered and hysterical—and alas, yes, that includes the performances of the two Oscar-nominated leads, Jon Voight and (especially) Eric Roberts—that the characters themselves never quite transcend their obvious places in the script's grand allegorical design.

My wife and I are one of many same-sex couples who lived under a strange compromise. I'll try to recap succinctly. We married in Massachusetts on December 31, 2004. Our marriage was legally invalidated by judges because we were not residents of Massachusetts, and there was a law against letting out-of-state couples marry there if their marriage would be illegal in their home state. (The original intent of the law was to prevent interracial couples from traveling out-of-state to marry in Massachusetts, which demonstrates how intertwined all sorts of oppression are.) Then that law was overturned, and around the same time, the State of New York began to honor marriages that had been contracted *out* of state. As in, one couldn't legally marry a same-sex partner in New York, but could marry out of state. L'Ailee and I went back to Massachusetts as close as we could to our anniversary and re-married.

But following the defeat at Arsenal, it seemed Balotelli’s biggest fan had finally given up on him. Mancini stated: “City cannot afford to play Balotelli anymore.

There will be a special mystery prize for this challenge and you will have 2 weeks to enter.
So why did Kunt and The Gang get nominated for the Malcolm Hardee Cunning Stunt Award for best publicity stunt promoting a performer or show at the Fringe?
I think their orientation was changing. We were really into Tweez, we were totally obsessed with that record. When Spiderland came out, a bunch of us said, "oh, well, I don't know about this..." That's pretty well stood the test of time. I've heard that record a few too many times, for sure, but side one of that you can't even touch. It's just really spectacular. And they did that when they were 20? They were really young when they did that.

If she were such a hardened criminal, why was she only carrying mace? If she were heavily into the drug lifestyle or possibly selling drugs, she would have been carrying a gun as well. It’s not unthinkable for a convicted felon to have a gun. In some cases, the ones who shouldn’t have them, it’s easier for them to obtain.
Pat Summitt to me is like the Phil Jackson of college basketball. Jackson is one of the greatest coaches in NBA history and won 11 NBA championships as a head coach. And he knows how to coach a team. Like Jackson, Pat is like a direct replica of Jackson except she is a female. You put these two on the same team coaching, that team should win every year.

Since I began the adventure by heading east, I guess the other part of the hammer will be further westward, so start inkling that way. I briefly lose my page, causing my character to undergo great confusion - "WTF, a dragon?! Two orcs!? A dude showing me his bicep?!" before coming to his senses and finding a well. I chuck a gold piece in, wishing for more gold, but nothing happens.

But he's also a writer of tough guy, Ludlumian fiction, with titles like The Apocalypse Directive, and America's Last Days: A Novel, and with his latest book, he's facing the same dilemma confronted by every tough guy American writer from James Fenimore Cooper to Ernest Hemingway to Norman Mailer: dismissive online reviews that seek to weaken his main character's bladder control.
Net result? Most computer programmers are guys. Not because they’re naturally more talented at it, and not even (entirely) because there are sexist barriers to entry to that field, but because when this generation of girls was ten years old, they were told by the media that tech is a boys’ world, and that the world to which they should aspire centers around housekeeping, looking pretty and breeding. Even if no one else in her life told her she couldn’t be a programmer, she’s unlikely to pursue that career because not enough people told her she could.

As I went down the stairs and was marching out the door a young, pretty woman came up to me and introduced herself. She said she was Laurel Wescott Rancitelli and was running for City Council and asked if I would sign her nomination papers. She told me her campaign motto is, "A Vote for Rancitelli is a Vote for Change!" I asked her about her education and she said she has a high school diploma and an Associate's Degree from STCC. I asked her why she didn't continue her education and she replied that she got such an attractive opportunity to work at a Catholic school that she couldn't turn it down. I regret that I didn't ask her position on birth control, but I signed her paper anyway and she seemed grateful, saying that she was just beginning her campaign.

In the top picture, I feel Vanessa Hudgens rocks her double denim look ONLY because the shorts she is wearing are black. Wearing double denim the SAME SHADE looks crappy (in my opinion of course).

I looked down at my dog, now licking my toes sticking out of the only pair of high-heeled sandals I owned. “No, I don’t, Betty. I know I’m good, but there are a lot of good musicians out there.” Now I was twirling the ends of my hair, but there was no way my mother or even myself would ever put it up into a chignon. It was stick straight, long—just past my shoulders, dark brown, and baby fine but silky, which is good, I suppose…the silky part, anyway. The closest I ever get to pinning my hair up is a ponytail. Everything else just slips through the hair ties.

It's gratifying that Michigan adults are now going to be treated the same as adults are treated in Ohio and Indiana, at least as far as fireworks go.
I see that ethics have all but been vanquished in the workplace, leaving only the least empathetic personalities to fill positions of usury and greed, and causing a form of stress that can only be described as a forced and burdensome moral subversion for those who otherwise might be content in an ethical and moral occupation. But most of our current employment opportunities require the very subversion of the people they are hired to help - be it “customer service”, “sales”, a “government representative”, or an “agent” of one form or the other, from insurance to collections to police to court workers. And like Pavlov’s Dog we are set forth on our workweek with a reward system, earning incentives and bonuses for the number of other people we can hurt for a profit; judged by how many worthless financial products or insurance policies we can unload through high pressure sales techniques that are required learning by unscrupulous corporations.
Let us celebrate the biological ties of motherhood, but let us also celebrate the power of love and nurturing from all the women in our lives, even those women with whom we share no blood ties: grandmothers and aunties; "play" mothers and godmothers; church mothers and neighborhood mothers. Celebrate all the women who were not allowed to be mothers to their children. Celebrate all the women who cannot or will not ever be mothers. Celebrate the women who made the courageous decision to give their children to families who could care for them. Celebrate the women who, when left and abandoned, made a way out of no way for their children. Celebrate all the complications of motherhood...even loss. And while you celebrate, say a prayer for those who so deeply feel the pain of being a motherless child, including those of us who are motherless mothers.

A couple of weeks ago my writing took a bit of a blow; having had a spectacular start to the masters course with A+ grades and general good feelings about my work coming from most angles, I decided to take some risks with my subject matter and style. I thought I had stepped up my game, I felt my prose had taken on a poetic aspect and I was writing the strange, macabre tales I would love to read. But, without any prior notice, my grade dropped rather significantly. Perhaps the risks were a mistake, or perhaps the process of marking creative writing will always be a subjective practice no matter how greatly objectivity is pursued. Either way I didn’t take the criticism very well. I called my friends who met me immediately in the pub for five hours of Articulate (possibly the best board game ever) and copious amounts of cloudy cider. Hugging the toilet bowl the following morning, a promise I had made myself a few years ago not to turn to alcohol in times of rejection/massive self-pity resurfaced. A little too late maybe, but I reaffirmed it that day all the same.
But 40% of those deemed ineligible are appealing against their ruling, with more than a third of them successfully overturning the verdict – which has led to a call for more judges to process the caseload.

They moved the tent. My brother handed the ashes to the worker who stood in the hole. He placed the box inside a steel box in the ground. Then they asked if we had anything else to place in the box with her. We didn’t know we could do that. No one told us and I didn’t think to ask. I had never done this before. But nephew’s mom had the bouquet which she was pleased to put in the box. I put in a red rose as did my sister-in-law. That was it. We didn’t know what else to do.

Let’s give truly fictional scenes a pass, after all this is just a parody of “you-know-which-book”.
Wow! That is a pretty big challenge. There is a reason it is called “the shadow”. It can be a bit scary to take an honest look at what we are feeling and why. Isn’t it easier to sit in judgment and blame someone else than to take 100% responsibility for our own thoughts and actions? Ya, I think so too! But I have realized in recent days, months, years that I need to take 100% accountability for everything that happened or continues to happen in my life. Whether it’s the abuse I endured as a child, the issues in my marriage, or what I perceive to be happening within the roller derby league I was practicing with. This book reiterates what I already believe and that is that “thoughts are things” and we create our own world based on our thoughts. When I think, “Well they don’t like me and are ignoring me and leaving me out because they don’t like me” then it sets that “wish” into motion and sure enough I get more of what I perceived to be true. This just shows me that I am feeling separate from others….separate from my self…separate from God/Love. Where there is separation, there is fear. Where there is fear, there is the shadow. Where there is shadow, there is dis-ease, pain, sadness.

When I was 13, it actually happened. We went through family therapy in which I found out my dad had cheated on my mom, more than once. I was upset, but he was still my father. I still wanted him to come to my recitals and award ceremonies, but soon realized that this desire was seen by mother as a slight. She took to ask us who we loved more, and when my dad came to pick us up, he didn’t come in the house. From that point on, my sister took on a lot of the work of raising me–she was the one who talked to me about college, taught me how to drive and took me to get my license, lectured me when I stayed out past curfew, got me up for church on Sundays, hugged me when my mom came home from work and spent the rest of the night in bed.

Planning to hit the studio in early June to lay down tracks for their third album, WOE’s reworked “Quietly, Undramatically” opens a new door on the title track from the band’s popular 2010 release of the same name. Vocalist/guitarist Chris Grigg notes, “the remixed version of ‘Quietly, Undramatically’ is a more accurate representation of what was hoped to achieve with the material and offers a different perspective into the album.” Decibel Magazine said, “Woe strive for sophistication without falling into the usual pitfalls of pretentiousness, cartoonish-ness or undue gloss. Essential aggression is maintained, while the atmospheric and emotional depth envelopes are pushed with a bold fearlessness.”

The fact that the 10-year period certain option costs very little extra is a factor, too, he says. For example, a $100,000 SPIA purchased by a 65-year-old man above would pay roughly $574 a month if he buys a $100,000 life-only SPIA, but only $23 less ($553 a month) if the SPIA is a life with 10-year period certain products.
On Saturday 07 April 2012 as previously mentioned briefly in this post (so this is sort of a repeat/recap), I received a package of 2011 Allen & Ginter Minis from Nick at Dime Boxes. I had sent him about 50 Vladimir Guerrero cards from Vlad's Expos years (a "Vlading" as it were it in reference to "Bipping" except I didn't send multiple duplicates, I think I only sent one dupe) and in the brotherly Trading Card Universe way he returned in kind, minus the Bipping er Vlad-ing by sending me 20 A&G Minis. I'll repeat the list of goodies and then highlight a few of them front and back.
Notes: The original recipe called for dried apricots/ sultanas (125gms) but I don't like to bite into those and so didn't bother adding them. If using, stir it in with the chicken stock.

Some people experienced quite a startle financially in 2008. Companies that had been extremely unstable for quite a while were recognized by the masses to be unstable upon the publicizing of those companies filing bankruptcy or or least nearing bankruptcy: yes US auto giants, but also mainstream financial institutions including Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, IndyMac, Countrywide, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual, and even the world’s largest insurance company, a US company that many in the US were not familiar with: AIG.

With a screenplay by Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel and Edward Bunker that was based on a script written by none other than Akira Kurosawa, Runaway Train aims to be the kind of mix of action-movie thrills, character study and philosophical discourse that Kurosawa often excelled at in his heyday. It thoroughly fulfills its first aim, with a handful of edge-of-your-seat stunts, action sequences and high-powered collisions to satisfy the popcorn crowd. As a character study, though, it's more problematic. Some of the dialogue is so ham-fisted in trying to explore its themes that it's almost a miracle that the actors manage to find imaginative ways to deliver it; on the other hand, some of that acting is just so mannered and hysterical—and alas, yes, that includes the performances of the two Oscar-nominated leads, Jon Voight and (especially) Eric Roberts—that the characters themselves never quite transcend their obvious places in the script's grand allegorical design.

In contrast, to address these challenges the SNP Government have focused upon reinvigorating our economy by investing in infrastructure projects such as building new homes, roads, hospitals and investments such as the new Airdrie Health Centre.

For a spotlight on science, three new books from Prometheus Books will provide some interesting reading. They are The Genesis of Science: The Story of Greek Imagination by Stephen Bertman ($27.00) who notes that, while historians often look to ancient Greece as the wellspring of Western civilization, perhaps the most significant achievement, other than democracy, was the early development of the sciences. The names of many of science’s branches have their roots in Greek words that first defined these disciplines. This is an excellent history. Science in America was of widespread interest to many of the Founding Fathers and, along with Franklin, one of the greatest, most inquiring minds was that of Thomas Jefferson. In A Professor, a President and a Meteor: The Birth of American Science, Cathryn J. Prince tells the story of a meteor crash in 1807 sparked the interest of a young chemistry professor at Yale College. His rigorous investigation of the event started a chain of events that lifted American science to international importance, unfortunately pitting him against then President Jefferson who took issue with it. It’s a lively story worth reading. Lastly, there’s The Wonder of Genetics: The Creepy, the Curious, and the Commonplace by Richard V. Knowles ($25.00) that provides a layman’s introduction and explanation of genetics, discussing its importance and scope. The author is an acclaimed geneticist who devotes chapter after chapter of a genuinely fascinating topic, discussing topics as diverse as genetically modified crops, cloning, genetic therapy, and how genes are related to many diseases, psychological disturbances, and possibly other behaviors. In short, you are your DNA! Finally, Quantum Physics for Poets by Leon M. Lederman, a Nobel Laureate, and Christopher T. Hill ($28.00) have taken on the job of explaining the heart of contemporary physics, the basis for understanding matter in its tiniest dimensions and the vastness of the universe, and they have succeeded. They have transformed what is an enigma for most people into a highly entertaining, lucid and informative book. If you have always been curious about it, this is the book to read!

So, she hovering just behind me as I’m printing. Not to be nosy, but just standing there. I’m hoping she won’t notice the company name in the label. Praying she won’t. Alas, I am not so lucky. I had already told her that I received stuff that wasn’t mine and how embarrassing it was and when she saw the label she of course started ribbing me about if it really wasn’t mine. I was utterly motified, but managed to play it off well. I was super embarrassed because if she saw it and had that reaction, how was I going to deal with it when I took it to UPS?? Thinking about it has me cringing even though I’m just returning things that were shipped to me on accident. Nothing to be embarrassed about, Girl!
Ernest Saves Christmas ... ABC Family ... 7 AM
The book is a young adult book very similar to The Hunger Game triology (and, yes, it is the first of a trilogy, too!). The story is about a 17 year old girl, Cassia, who lives in a "Utopian" (or dystopian) society. The Society has everything figured out - the decide who you marry, how many kids you have, how much food you need to eat, and even when you die - at the perfect age of 80 (when you have lived a good, long life but before you start feeling 'useless').
Notes: The original recipe called for dried apricots/ sultanas (125gms) but I don't like to bite into those and so didn't bother adding them. If using, stir it in with the chicken stock.
I put all of the individual movies in the front of the bin, and then halfway through, I placed all of our movies with sequels, leaving some extra spaces for ones we know are coming out or we need to add too. And of course, it's never hard to find a movie in the case because we always have our movie inventory key to reference!
Entire communities devastated? All ADL pro-hate law propaganda from America to Europe to Australia allege that a hate crime is worthy of at least triple penalties because it savages not only the victim but "tears whole communities apart." Such may have occurred in some instances during post-reconstruction lynchings in the American South. But when was the last time you read of such social devastation resulting from a hate crime in America?

Germany’s EU commissioner Günther Oettinger said Europe should send blue helmets to take control of Greek tax collection and liquidate state assets. They had better be well armed. The headlines in the Greek press have been “Unconditional Capitulation”, and “Terrorization of Greeks”, and even “Fourth Reich”. #6 Everyone knows that Greece simply cannot last much longer without continued bailouts. John Mauldin explained why this is so in a recent article….

It wasn’t until I heard that she had gotten pregnant that I realized it all!”

Rea: Your first relationships are often the most intense and impressionable of your life. You’re not yet bombarded with paying bills or having a steady job – you can enjoy each other – you can focus on your feelings and not much else. As we grow older, this is what we often lose sight of: each other. This book reminds you of what’s important at any stage in relationships – focusing on what you appreciate about the person, not what annoys you.

Six months ago, Angela fell pregnant. I asked if she would be paid maternity benefit. She said Pecksniff had said no. I asked if Pecksniff was contributing to UIF (unemployment insurance fund) on Angela’s behalf (legally all employers and employees earning below a certain amount must contribute to UIF). Angela wasn’t sure. If Pecksniff and Angela contribute to UIF then she is able to register for a maternity benefit from the state. Do bear in mind Pecksniff’s words in her letter pertaining to price increases.

Hi Folks! I’m a pacifist at heart and I have no desire to see guns in the school. But I also have no desire to see a boy told he cannot wear the hat he decorated with toy soldiers because the soldiers are carrying — guess what? Toy guns.
Now that my life has returned to normal after the chaos from last week, I decided I needed to hunker down and get back to the grind of my daily workout. I slacked a lot last week. In fact, I only walked one day with Megan. That was the only exercise I got all week, aside from chasing after three kids, of course.
It took them rather longer, looking back, than one might have expected, but they obviously thought very hard, particularly after the second summer, 2007, and said, "We're not going to get anywhere taking on the British soldiers at what they do best; ergo we will find another way".
Endings. Again, like The House of the Devil - which I'm constantly comparing to as it's such an awesome movie - The Innkeepers somewhat challenges its audience. Did it really happen? I know of people who read the ending of The House of the Devil as a possible “dream state/imaginary” space as to say that the movie never really happened… strange yes, and I do not really agree with it either, but at the same time, I definitely feel that The Innkeepers does pose similar questions. Did it really happen or was it in the state of fear and confusion that brought it all on? The last shot lingers on for an eternity before presenting the answer. And I also find that last scene to be part of the intelligent narrative that West uses in The Innkeepers. It's not to unlike the viral video that was seen earlier. He builds to a climax with the exact same tricks that the viral video does. And this is a motif that I find runs vibrantly though the movie. Is it real or all just a trick? During the last half hour, I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a scene where Claire wakes up and it all had been a dream. Now this doesn’t happen obviously, but in some strange way there’s a feeling that it could have happened in the last act.

I see in Forrest Gump the most important qualities for a man to success: faith and persistence. He firmly believes in what he is doing and does everything with his full capacity. When he was young, he was only good at was running. He also enjoyed it. So he ran at his best and got into the football team, which later led him into college. In the Vietnam war, he followed the Lieutenant faithfully and treated him sincerely, which earned him a valuable lifelong friendship. Moreover, he was able to retreat when he could not fight through. He memorized Jenny’s words well: “Never try to be brave”. When one’s in overwhelming danger, the most optimal strategy is indeed saving up one’s energy for a better future.

5. Road trip. I’ve been thinking about this one for quite some time. I don’t know how feasible this is, especially since I’ll be working full time, but I’d like to make some road trips east over a couple weekends or so. I’ve always been interested in experiencing the other parts of America (especially non-coastal states), because I feel there is a vast disconnect between coastal and non-coastal states. I would ideally get a lot of driving done on awesome roads, see lots of interesting sights, and learn new things. Not sure if I want to go it alone or bring along some friends. Friends are always fun, but I think solo trips bring in a completely different experience, which could be good for me as well. I guess we’ll see!

Scientist - Scientist Rids the World of the Evil Curse of the Vampires
On the afternoon of Monday, January 8, 1912, Mrs. Grace Johnson, the director of the Springfield Museum of Natural History and Miss Fannie Stebbins, the supervisor of natural science for the Springfield School Department, assembled a group of amateur bird watchers and organized the Springfield Bird Club. The purpose of the club was “to attract, conserve and study birds.” A century later, the Allen Bird Club, as it soon came to be known, is still carrying out this original purpose.

When my children are very young, they are not always able to understand and consider my needs. The friendships may look lopsided, just as some of my adult friendships do when one of us is going through difficult times. But I trust that if my children grow up being treated like my friends, they will know how to be friends. I look forward to great friendships with both of them. A war involves hostages. In some parent-child relationships, the child is almost like a hostage. But friendship does not involve hostages.

Tomorrow is my 30th birthday. Friday is Caleb's due date. I'll never be able to forget his due date because it's so close to my birthday. I had it in my head that maybe I'd go into labor a few days early and we'd share a birthday. Or even better, he'd be born a few days early and I'd still be able to say I was 29 when I had him. I should be worrying about my mucus plug falling out or my water breaking in the middle of Target, not worrying about whether surgery is the right decision and whether I'll ever be lucky enough to be pregnant again. Can this week just please be over?

She asks how people will know whom they’ve reached. I figure you either know me and will leave a message or you hope you know me, leave a message and take your chances. The last thing I want to do is give someone from whom I may not want to hear more information about me. I don’t want to validate telemarketers or let the robocallers know that they’ve reached a live one.

Brake seem to want to teach kids that it's alright to just walk out into the road because they will have successfully removed cars from the equation. Brake was founded after a truck with dodgy brakes killed the founders mother. I am human enough to sympathise with that, I think any decent person would be but they've lost all perspective on the real World. Had they just been a group that focused on car safety improvements, I'd have no issue with them. As it is, they've taken their extreme views to an almost Biblical level, and you all know what I think to the Bible.

Hola from Peru! We are the May Peru trip leaders Jess and Holly. We have had an incredible first few days and are excited to have started placements. We have had the wonderful opportunity of being able to watch the participants experience new relationships, new opportunities, and immerse themselves in the Peruvian culture. This week we are working on the construction of a daycare in Pacifico de Villa, as well as assisting at Laura Alva Saldana; a school for children with exceptionalities, and teaching English to children at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey schools. I (Jess) have been working at Laura Alva Saldana with four participants, where I would assist them with communicating with the teachers and students. While I (Holly) have been working at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey, assisting participants as they teach children English at the primary and secondary level. We would like to turn it over to a few of our participants, as they will be sharing some of their experiences this week. We encourage you to follow along with us on our amazing journey.
Many of the affected women were unionized but their unions, dominated by men, supported the ordinance.

Then there's the stuff that isn't about hitting -- Cameron was a much faster and better base runner -- he stole almost 300 bases in his career, and he scored runs at about the same rate as Rice even though he hit 100 fewer home runs one his career.

Both metaphors and similes are wonderful things in fiction--they allow us to manipulate words and make them into pictures. They make our stories visual, which means we're engaging multiple senses and the more senses you can engage, the more real your story feels. So, we shall all agree that metaphors and similes are wonderful things.

The fact that the 10-year period certain option costs very little extra is a factor, too, he says. For example, a $100,000 SPIA purchased by a 65-year-old man above would pay roughly $574 a month if he buys a $100,000 life-only SPIA, but only $23 less ($553 a month) if the SPIA is a life with 10-year period certain products.

They say in AA that the first step is admitting that you have a problem. I’ve never been to AA but I have to think they must be right. It seems pretty obvious. After all, you can’t exactly fight something before you realize it’s something that needs to be fought. I definitely have problem. I have ADD and I’m stressed. I can’t focus, I can’t relax, and I feel like I have no control over my life and what I actually want out of it. So here I am. I’m on a self-inflicted seclusion in the middle of nowhere, smack-dab in the middle of the great ol’ US of A. The town is called Moorhead and it’s in Minnesota, bordering North Dakota and slightly bigger town called Fargo. You may have heard about it. They made a movie. I won’t bore you with the details of my expedition, or berate you with the fact that Fargo (the movie) was actually a misnomer because it was the Minnesota, that is, Moorhead, police that actually solved the crime (actually, in retrospect, I guess I will). I also won’t bore you with the all details of my drive, yes drive, out here which include two and a half days of my cat meowing (yes, she meowed the whole way). I still hear her in my head. Meow. Meoooow. Meoowwww. As if a chainsaw was cutting her in half, while she was being choked by fishing line, and I was just watching. Trust me, none of that happened.

Formal confirmation as to whether the action has been raised in England or Scotland is awaited. As I have said many times, any action should be raised in England as the financial pressures on the defender to settle are so much higher, and the “no win, no fee” provisions so much more favourable for claimants.

Renaud Lavillenie. Lavillenie increased his best from 18' 6" to 19' 8.25" - becoming a serious threat to the 20 foot barrier. He brings his considerable skills to New York where he will go up against Tim Mack who has an identical PR set back in 2004. Add 19' 2.50" vaulter Derek Miles to the mix and we should see some very high attempts in New York.

What the parties wanted to know was whether the exception for ephemeral recordings under copyright law also covered recordings made by legally independent external television production companies where those recordings were commissioned from them by DR or by TV2 Danmark for initial broadcast on DR or TV2 Danmark. According to DR and TV2 Danmark, it was irrelevant to copyright holders whether recordings for purposes of transmission were made by the staff of thea broadcasting organisation itself with its own equipment, or by an employee of a third company from which the broadcasting organisation commissioned the production, with that third company’s equipment. They also argued that there was no condition in Paragraph 31 of the Danish Law on Copyright to require broadcasting organisations to make recordings ‘by means of their own facilities’. Thus, under Danish law, it didn' tmatter, for the application of the exception concerning recordings for the purpose of transmission, whether those recordings were made by employees of the broadcasting organisation or by employees of third parties. NCB however argued that European Union law imposed a condition relating to production ‘by means of their own facilities’, this condition being applicable under the Danish Law on Copyright. The Østre Landsret (Eastern Regional Court) decided at this point that it was better to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling than to become increasingly baffled by these arguments. Accordingly it asked::

I have one of those phone messages people complain about. I tell callers what number they have dialed and kindly ask them to leave a message if they are so inclined. My mother hates my message. She asks how people will know whom they’ve reached. I figure you either know me and will leave a message or you hope you know me, leave a message and take your chances. The last thing I want to do is give someone from whom I may not want to hear more information about me. I don’t want to validate telemarketers or let the robocallers know that they’ve reached a live one.

Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies.
Then it was back on the bus for drive to lunch. I'm not sure if the driver followed the "official" route, because he took us through a local neighborhood that didn't look like it saw a lot of traffic. When we got to the restaurant, we got another small glass of punch, then there was a man taking snapshots of each party before before they were seated. The buffet lunch included salad, jerk chicken, pork, mutton with potatoes, rice pasties, and several kinds of cookies and pastries for dessert.

I am writing this awkwardly with one of my cats on the desk half lying on the key board – a favourite position of his I wouldn’t dream of interfering with. His sister prefers to watch television. I have been answering emails (tardily – post a virus and subsequent new laptop) from many of you through both the blog and the website and I am just amazed at the interest in Christian and the emotion he still generates. Please keep sending me stories about your own animals, or YouTube links of cats (or dogs!), or what Christian means to you. I’m sure we are building an invaluable archive.

Sunday morning, the hubs and I laid around lazy for most of the morning but around lunchtime, I got bit by the cleaning bug and organized the nursery (for the 300th time). Once I got done cleaning, it was dinner time so I whipped up some delicious pork chops just in time to watch the Patriots beat the Ravens by the hair on their chinny chin chin! It was such a good game and I'm glad to see my dad's team going to the superbowl, yet again.
For starters, no one is property, we are not owned by anyone. Second of all, women especially are not property. To me, that shows insecurity, and the fact that this kid said it the way he did, I think either he learned it from friends or his own dad. Plus, he crashed her car, she didn’t crash it, and yet he is telling her to ‘shut up’ which is the most uncalled for act he could have done besides referring to her as his ‘property.’ It wasn’t her fault, it was his, but the whole endeavor was just uncalled for
About 30 minutes before serving soup, drop noodles in and cook. Add some fresh chopped parsley right before serving. Enjoy.

What I really loved about this recipe though is that you prepare it the night before and it's all ready to go the next morning. Brilliant! I adore waffles on the weekend but sometimes I just want to sit with my coffee and relax rather than make a big breakfast. It was so nice to plug in the waffle iron and have a steamy hot fluffy waffle on my plate a few minutes later. Love this and will definitely make again!

You may ask, then, why I have chosen a ball perched atop a steep hill to represent the very foundation of contemporary society. I make no claims of any great knowledge in neurology, psychology, anthropology, or sociology, but there is one characteristic of our society that my own observations have repeatedly led me to: this hill, this very foundation, is unstable. At any point, a small amount of force applied in the right direction can start the ball rolling back down, back to stable ground, to the agrarian, community-based economics practiced for so much of human history. A small shift in day-to-day life, or the rediscovery of a older, simpler tradition that, in the hustle and bustle of modern life, we didn’t realize we had forgotten – these little events on a societal or, more likely, personal level, can start the ball rolling. Moreover, if strong enough, they can completely derail all of the artificiality, materialism, and vice which have been forced upon us (by whom?: that is a whole discussion in itself), in order to separate us from our roots and keep us in a state of near-subservience.

If you’ve spent the day dodging showers and are currently sat at home with a cup of tea staring out of a rain soaked window then look away from this blog now…Because that’s what today is ALL about! In contrast to our weeks of no rain and dry grounds, we’ve consistently had rain pretty much for the past week now. But we’re still in a drought, of course. With today being quite hectic and involving a bit of flitting about all over the place, I took the opportunity to take my photos whilst sat in the car. That’s right! Lazy!

Stained glass art can also be appreciated for how the artist may present the story in each glass “frame” to draw in the viewer. At times, the frame is just a reflective chapter of a larger stained glass artwork narrative.
And when Stuckey talks about whether “the city steps up,” he’s certainly not endorsing an open bidding process or ULURP, either of which might have delivered a project that gained more public support and delivered affordable housing earlier.
Over the course of the week, I did daily yoga in addition to the other parts of the program which the participants mostly did at home on our own, following the instructions of the leader. For a few days, we ate a completely raw, vegan diet. We took salt water baths and drank small amounts of senna tea nightly. I napped a lot. Later in the week, we juice fasted. We did an internal salt water bath. Twice, we participated in a sweat lodge at the Lake Claire land trust.

Given that the film is all about singing, there is of course a litany of catchy tunes waiting to infect your hind brain and refuse to leave for days and weeks to come. Scarily enough, most of them sounded like Lily Allen’s ‘Not Fair’. Sitting watching a kids’ film whilst a song about premature ejaculation plays over and over in your head is a surreal experience to say the least. And not one I would care to repeat.

On the road, the Prius c’s cabin is quiet, its ride smooth and well-controlled. Unlike the Liftback, its steering wheel feels like it’s actually connected to the front wheels, without the giant dead spot on-center you’ll find with most new cars. As with other hybrids, the brakes will be grabby until you discover how to modulate the pedal, this because regenerative braking is supplementing the wheel brakes.
We see this in Hebrews 10:19-22, where we are encouraged to come near to God in “the house of God” through the torn “veil” of the broken “flesh”, and through the shed blood, which is “sprinkled” (cp. 9:21) on our hearts, of Christ the “High Priest”. It is impossible to exclude the Eucharist from our interpretation of this passage, especially since this entrance into “the Holiest” is said to be a “new and living way”, while the Eucharist, which also happens in the house of God, the Church, is called the “new covenant”.
In the bowl of a standing mixer with the flat beater attachment, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt lemon zest, and poppy seeds on low speed for 30 seconds. Add the butter and the remaining sour cream. Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened. Raise the speed to medium and beat for 1 1/2 minutes. The mixture will lighten in color and texture. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.

There have been claims made that it is possible to make $300 per week with this method. That might be possible for the first few weeks, but eventually you are going to start running out of offers that you are eligible to complete. The reason for this is that you can only do each offer one time, even if it is for a different program. So you can’t sign up for Netflix for the free laptop program, cancel and then sign up again for the free digital camera program.

Just sending money to a few orphanages instead of supporting a holistic approach to social justice that raises the standard of living for everyone is very problematic. It’s bad aid, not smart aid.
After having her throat hemorrhage surgery in November, Adele was advised to take time off her singing career which she says it helped to regain a perspective on her career: “It was so fast-paced I could hardly ever remember the bulk of my day. I think I just needed to be silenced. And when you are silent, everyone around you is silent. So the noise in my life just stopped. It was like floating in the sea for the weeks. It was brilliant.”
And here's where the second part of bravery comes in.
Everyday, I read quotations by many different people who in some way or another have inspired me or who's work has resonated within me. Words are such powerful weapons, quotations can alter my mindset, comfort me, make me re-asess... but either way it's the power of words which at an early age drew me to get pen to paper and begin writing, the idea that words can have such a profound effect on people on a deeper level and higher consciousness is astounding.
i for one LOVE jumpsuits they are so effortless and just take the thought out of getting dressed in the morning cos its a 2in1, top with an attached bottom piece! i recommend everyone purchase a jumpsuit (you can thank me later.. in Drakes voice..) and i dare you not to love it! this can also be jazzed up with accessories.

Matthew's class had a field trip out to LaFayette to the Children's Museum of Acadiana. It was just a regular children's museum - nothing specific to Acadia. And it was an expensive field trip. I wonder how families with tighter budgets than ours make this work.
There are a few tactics used to gain subscribers. Some sites hit you with a popup as soon as you come to it, asking you to subscribe. I for one abhor these popups (to spite claims they work), because if I haven’t even read your content yet, no way am I going to start handing you my information (even tho I am sure you will respect all my privacy). Some people put content plugs in their material for subscribers (it is on the right, it says “Follow the madness.”). But I have my doubts shameless plugs will do it either.

He brings his considerable skills to New York where he will go up against Tim Mack who has an identical PR set back in 2004. Add 19' 2.50" vaulter Derek Miles to the mix and we should see some very high attempts in New York.
I see in Forrest Gump the most important qualities for a man to success: faith and persistence. He firmly believes in what he is doing and does everything with his full capacity. When he was young, he was only good at was running. He also enjoyed it. So he ran at his best and got into the football team, which later led him into college. In the Vietnam war, he followed the Lieutenant faithfully and treated him sincerely, which earned him a valuable lifelong friendship. Moreover, he was able to retreat when he could not fight through. He memorized Jenny’s words well: “Never try to be brave”. When one’s in overwhelming danger, the most optimal strategy is indeed saving up one’s energy for a better future.
Hola from Peru! We are the May Peru trip leaders Jess and Holly. We have had an incredible first few days and are excited to have started placements. We have had the wonderful opportunity of being able to watch the participants experience new relationships, new opportunities, and immerse themselves in the Peruvian culture. This week we are working on the construction of a daycare in Pacifico de Villa, as well as assisting at Laura Alva Saldana; a school for children with exceptionalities, and teaching English to children at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey schools. I (Jess) have been working at Laura Alva Saldana with four participants, where I would assist them with communicating with the teachers and students. While I (Holly) have been working at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey, assisting participants as they teach children English at the primary and secondary level. We would like to turn it over to a few of our participants, as they will be sharing some of their experiences this week. We encourage you to follow along with us on our amazing journey.

In candolim, I cycled first to the apartments, where mum would arrive later in the evening, where I would come eventually to surprise her, and left a little birthday note (it was her birthday) and then headed for the beach. I could feel my brain boiling in its fluid by the time I found a way to the beach. But I still had to drag my cycle across the sand, now that we’d come this far, it had to see the sea as well. It is hard work dragging a cycle in the sand but I got it there and headed for one of the shacks. Putting the stand on one of my chappals in the shade, I stood staring at the sea, taking it all in, for a long moment before finally settling down into a chair and ordering a large lunch. I’d left home with a little less than 500 bucks, and now, four days later (and much thanks to Suji) I had about

He would win true acclaim and popularity, however, as the city's district attorney proper, serving first from 1853-1859 and again from 1861-1869, one of New York's most important legal voices during the Civil War. He allegedly prosecuted over 12,000 cases. He was also on hand during the Draft Riots, funneling many rioters through the court system and straight to jail. His accomplice was often judge John Hoffman, soon to be the mayor of New York who preceded Hall. Their crusades against rioters would boost both their popularity.

I had never heard of the designation CODA (Child of Deaf Adult) until after I moved away from home and saw the Hallmark movie “Love is Never Silent.” In the movie, there’s a confrontational scene between the deaf parents and the hearing daughter after she’s moved away from home. During that scene, I broke down and sobbed like I’d never cried in all my life. In fact, I couldn’t even talk about that movie for a couple of years without starting to cry. I wasn’t angry with my parents. Nor do I think I had an unlucky childhood. That movie began a process which helped me learn how important it is that I embrace who I am. I am in both worlds, both deaf and hearing. My personality is different in each world. When I sign to deaf people I’m no longer shy. If I see a deaf person signing, I want to go over and introduce myself. In the hearing world, I’m much more reserved. Since then, I’ve learned to recognize that I can live in both worlds at the same time.

Entire communities devastated? All ADL pro-hate law propaganda from America to Europe to Australia allege that a hate crime is worthy of at least triple penalties because it savages not only the victim but "tears whole communities apart." Such may have occurred in some instances during post-reconstruction lynchings in the American South. But when was the last time you read of such social devastation resulting from a hate crime in America?

Even if the flute gets the spotlight for most of the time, TAAB2 is still a progressive rock album at its core. The songs are very well glued together, complex and intricate. Overshadowed by the flute as they might be, the guitars still sound pretty bad ass and the drumming is top notch. Because Ian’s voice is not as good as it was in his youth, he turned to a more mellow, low tone pitched delivery and, frankly, that’s a good thing; it blends very well with the album, and it proves that Ian is the kind of artist that is very aware of his limits and writes his songs accordingly. He hasn’t turned soft, if that’s what you’re thinking, nor has his music suffered a decline in quality – it’s just a tad different from what he used to do and it suits him well.

Rudyard Kipling achieved fame quickly, based initially on his first stories and poems written in India (he returned there after College), and his great popularity with the British public continued despite subsequent critical reaction to some of his more conservative work, and critical opinion in later years that his poetry was superficial and lacking in depth of meaning.
Also, Jen, if you're going to call out gay bashers, you may wish to start with...

Counsel for the US Government went very close to arguing that TV Links was wrongly decided. In any event, Counsel sought to distinguish Mr O'Dwyer's behaviour from the restrictive decision in TVLinks. First the TVShack websites were entirely in the hands of Richard O’Dwyer and his co-conspirators, requiring third parties to sign up to TVShack and be vetted before going further. Secondly, unlike TVLinks, there was no attempt to protect copyright, as Mr O'Dwyer knew materials were subject to copyright and actively taunted already-cited efforts in June 2010 to seize TVShack.net.

The best part of my day: opening the garage door and hearing Hannah shout, “Daddy!” As I open the kitchen door, I hear these little feet pounding the linoleum floor, and I know it’s only moments until I see her come around the corner with that big smile on her face. I frantically place my keys and phone onto the counter in order to have my hands empty before she reaches me. I pick her up for our daily bear hug, and she updates me on what happened that day. I carry her into the living room where Naomi is trying to roll over, and we spend the next hour playing together. It’s the most incredible feeling in the world, and it must be how God feels when we want to spend time with Him as much as our kids want to spend time with us.

We see this in Hebrews 10:19-22, where we are encouraged to come near to God in “the house of God” through the torn “veil” of the broken “flesh”, and through the shed blood, which is “sprinkled” (cp. 9:21) on our hearts, of Christ the “High Priest”. It is impossible to exclude the Eucharist from our interpretation of this passage, especially since this entrance into “the Holiest” is said to be a “new and living way”, while the Eucharist, which also happens in the house of God, the Church, is called the “new covenant”.

The best part of my day: opening the garage door and hearing Hannah shout, “Daddy!” As I open the kitchen door, I hear these little feet pounding the linoleum floor, and I know it’s only moments until I see her come around the corner with that big smile on her face. I frantically place my keys and phone onto the counter in order to have my hands empty before she reaches me. I pick her up for our daily bear hug, and she updates me on what happened that day. I carry her into the living room where Naomi is trying to roll over, and we spend the next hour playing together. It’s the most incredible feeling in the world, and it must be how God feels when we want to spend time with Him as much as our kids want to spend time with us.

The incident has raised concerns for the medical-marijuana community in California, particularly the Harborside Health Center, a regulated dispensary also based in Oakland, which also happens to be the largest in the World. Harborside has had various threats from the IRS over the last two years regarding its business conduct, documented in ‘Weed Wars’, a program broadcast on the Discovery Channel. Assessing the situation from afar it seems noticeable that the authorities chose to attack the university (instead of just a dispensary) – perhaps because of their free licence to spread information on private production of cannabis and profiteering as a business, rather than just selling and distributing the drug. To try and determine the objectives of the authorities and federal agents who organised the raid, their concern on this front seems more understandable; the desire to exercise their power and eliminate personal usage whilst discrediting the facts and existing information.

I ran and ran and ran and waited and waited and waited for the vibration. All you Garmin users are asking yourself WHY I didn’t just look at my Garmin and see where the mileage was at, right? I know you are. It’s okay. I’m not offended. The fact is that I don’t like to watch the mileage tick off, which is one of the reasons I love the 610. I don’t have to! I can swipe my screen and have the time showing (or the virtual partner, which I have to figure out how to adjust because that dude runs at a 9:05 pace and I will never catch him). I prefer to have the clock face showing because it’s more important that I get back to my house by 5:30 than what pace or how far I’ve run.

Net result? Most computer programmers are guys. Not because they’re naturally more talented at it, and not even (entirely) because there are sexist barriers to entry to that field, but because when this generation of girls was ten years old, they were told by the media that tech is a boys’ world, and that the world to which they should aspire centers around housekeeping, looking pretty and breeding. Even if no one else in her life told her she couldn’t be a programmer, she’s unlikely to pursue that career because not enough people told her she could.

We checked into our hotel that evening and had dinner (thank you Aunt Roxie) in our rooms. The children were (and still are) disappointed that the heated outdoor pool is only open seasonally (still not sure which season) and that the wifi is spotty at best – the teenagers are having the roughest time with this!

All his brothers decisively followed him, having seen that the immorality of Kali-yuga had embraced the relations of all the people of earth. They had done everything saintly and accomplished everything worldly. They knew the ultimate destination and origin of the soul. So, their minds always embraced the lotus-like feet of The Tranquil.

Beech leaves have begun their acid-green emergence into air, water, light. Dog and I are kneedeep in ramsons and bluebells, lit by the occasional creamy wild arum. Each time we come to a storm-felled tree across the path, its continuation the other side is a little wilder, a little more dense with bluebells until we're wading in an ultraviolet stream into the heartlands.
I used to envy my younger brother at these times and for a number of reasons. The first being that as he always received his belting second, my dads efforts would be significantly less, having already tired out his swinging arm on me. The second, for some reason no matter how hard the punishment was and how much yelling was going on, my brother had a habit of laughing uncontrollably throughout the whole thing. I now realise that this was probably a nervous laughter, coming out of fear but at the time I just wished that I could have seen even a fracture of the humour I perceived that he was seeing. The third and probably the most valid, my brother was a naughty child, he did do things that were nasty and horrible and inexplicable. He showed no fear in his actions and if he thought something seemed like a good idea at the time, he did it. I envied the fact that even though he was being punished for his actions, at least he had the benefit of having done what he wanted and had fun doing it.
Since being practically forced into doing a bold lip everyday for work, I've fallen in love with lipstick so much that I continue to do bold lip looks on my days off!

Penny Alesi recalls Idema's screams into the speakerphone and calling the persons on the receiving end vile names who preformed unspeakable sexual acts. Ms. Alesi and her “family” of three American cats were then living with Idema from March 31, 2009 - September 17, 2009; and was his close companion every single day. What she experienced in those months of horror will never be forgotten: Idema was constantly breaking phones, glasses, ashtrays, anything within reach because he was not happy with the way things were going in the States. However, he would not even attempt to return to America because he was afraid that the FBI had a sealed indictment that would put him in jail the moment he stepped foot on U.S. soil. Thus he would do all his business via phone, computer and fax. The problem was that Idema had broken rule number one of a successful con artist by drinking to excess and using illegal drugs like cocaine. As if wasn't enough to blow his cool, the dust to dawn bizarre sex escapades at his Casa Arabi that by themselves would have driven anyone over the edge.

I like to listen to Dave Ramsey. I find him to be very encouraging, not only about money, but about life in general. I’d also like to change my view, my family history of money. I don’t want to think of myself as poor. Just because my parents were in debt, and their parents before them, even if they weren’t in debt, were at least very poor, doesn’t have to mean that I can’t be successful financially in my life.
In a preview of an upcoming episode from ABC’s program, What Would You Do?, an irritated diner patron comes to the aid of a waitress being verbally harassed by another customer. The waitress ins questions, is a real transgender woman but the verbally-abusive customer is an actor. The program puts forth an interesting scenario, and one that I’m sure plays out more and more often, and it’s great to see someone standing up for the woman, who is, indeed, just trying to do her job. Interestingly, when the actor asks the irritated patron if he thinks it’s “ok for someone to be disgusting,” the patron replies, “It’s okay to be whoever you want to be. This is America.”

I hung up the phone and snuggled under the sheet, looking through the mosquito net that made the orange ambient street light streaming through the window fuzzy.

#738 - Tabu, A Story of the South Seas (1931) - (#228 on TSPDT) This Muranu film (co-directed of sorts with Robert Flaherty), the director's final film, released just after his death, is the highest ranked film in this update, and for the most part (excepting the two Renoir and Flaherty's own Louisiana Story) deserves to be. A fascinating look at tribal culture and law in the form of a tragic romance. History tells us that Flaherty was not happy with Murnau's screenplay - calling it too westernized - but even with this dissent, the combination of the German auteur's directorial prowess and Flaherty's naturalistic filmmaking style, make for a surprisingly intriguing work of cinematic art. I suppose considering this is a film from these two men, I should not be all that surprised at its bravura standing.

If violent video games were the cause for aggression in school, then there would be far more violence than we are seeing today. The truth is, despite all of the lobbying to get parental warnings on video games, the number one sellers for each year are always first person shooters. So why are we seeing an increase in emotional support schools and not an increase in violent behaviors associated with these graphic games? The answer shouldn’t surprise you. We have effectively misplaced our direction to focus on the outward sources rather than the inward struggle.
The Koetong Pub was built back in 1883 as a coach house and rest-stop along what is now the Snowy Valleys Way – a nice drive comprising a nice lazy arc that runs from Beechworth in North-East Victoria to Gundagai in New South Wales and manages to shoe-horn 45 pubs into a drive that might take no more than a few hours.

Planning to hit the studio in early June to lay down tracks for their third album, WOE’s reworked “Quietly, Undramatically” opens a new door on the title track from the band’s popular 2010 release of the same name. Vocalist/guitarist Chris Grigg notes, “the remixed version of ‘Quietly, Undramatically’ is a more accurate representation of what was hoped to achieve with the material and offers a different perspective into the album.” Decibel Magazine said, “Woe strive for sophistication without falling into the usual pitfalls of pretentiousness, cartoonish-ness or undue gloss. Essential aggression is maintained, while the atmospheric and emotional depth envelopes are pushed with a bold fearlessness.”

I see that ethics have all but been vanquished in the workplace, leaving only the least empathetic personalities to fill positions of usury and greed, and causing a form of stress that can only be described as a forced and burdensome moral subversion for those who otherwise might be content in an ethical and moral occupation. But most of our current employment opportunities require the very subversion of the people they are hired to help - be it “customer service”, “sales”, a “government representative”, or an “agent” of one form or the other, from insurance to collections to police to court workers. And like Pavlov’s Dog we are set forth on our workweek with a reward system, earning incentives and bonuses for the number of other people we can hurt for a profit; judged by how many worthless financial products or insurance policies we can unload through high pressure sales techniques that are required learning by unscrupulous corporations.

As with most studies, there are limitations to the data. The study focused on data from registries instead of actual ADHD patients. Data was collected for more than 150,000 individuals currently taking drugs such as Ritalin or Concerta. These persons were compared to 434,000 people who were not taking these medications. The researchers found that over 1,300 participants had a heart attack, stroke, or cardiac related death. However, the drugs were not an increased risk to the deaths. In addition, neither age nor a history of heart disease added risk to ADHD drug users. Researchers also found that the deaths were the same during the use of an ADHD drug and a year after use had ceased.

On the road, the Prius c’s cabin is quiet, its ride smooth and well-controlled. Unlike the Liftback, its steering wheel feels like it’s actually connected to the front wheels, without the giant dead spot on-center you’ll find with most new cars.

You may ask, then, why I have chosen a ball perched atop a steep hill to represent the very foundation of contemporary society. I make no claims of any great knowledge in neurology, psychology, anthropology, or sociology, but there is one characteristic of our society that my own observations have repeatedly led me to: this hill, this very foundation, is unstable. At any point, a small amount of force applied in the right direction can start the ball rolling back down, back to stable ground, to the agrarian, community-based economics practiced for so much of human history. A small shift in day-to-day life, or the rediscovery of a older, simpler tradition that, in the hustle and bustle of modern life, we didn’t realize we had forgotten – these little events on a societal or, more likely, personal level, can start the ball rolling. Moreover, if strong enough, they can completely derail all of the artificiality, materialism, and vice which have been forced upon us (by whom?: that is a whole discussion in itself), in order to separate us from our roots and keep us in a state of near-subservience.
5. Road trip. I’ve been thinking about this one for quite some time. I don’t know how feasible this is, especially since I’ll be working full time, but I’d like to make some road trips east over a couple weekends or so. I’ve always been interested in experiencing the other parts of America (especially non-coastal states), because I feel there is a vast disconnect between coastal and non-coastal states. I would ideally get a lot of driving done on awesome roads, see lots of interesting sights, and learn new things. Not sure if I want to go it alone or bring along some friends. Friends are always fun, but I think solo trips bring in a completely different experience, which could be good for me as well. I guess we’ll see!
There is also a photograph of a man standing at a press table in the middle of an empty arena, his hand covering his face in expressionistic gesture. This man seems like discoursing minister, full of pomp and rhetoric, and what occurs here is quite interesting. Does Pfeiffer suggest that signifiers of video and spectacle inducing media cover up feelings in society that seem to be much like old fashion worship? Are basketball players and media figures our temporary gods, replaced each night by new symbols? There is pessimism at work here.
"It could only happen on Top Of The Pops - it's classical guitar" If you like, Jimmy. "Where could you get such class except Top Of The Pops?" rhetorically asks a man who chose to dress like that. Both parties sit, the crowd stand pensively around the perimeter of a small circular stage I don't think we've ever seen before. It's pretty much what you'd expect Feelings performed by Cleo Laine with John Williams to sound like, a reminder that throughout this decade you'd get stuff well out of the pop loop - the Shadows were regulars well into the 80s - in an attempt to paint the show as inclusive and classy. The response is appropriately Two Ronnies audience-like.

Oprah was so impressed that she decided to do a feature on it in her magazine. She also asked me to organize her shoe room.

I was rather glad afterwards. I'd had the chance to get myself angry at a missed chance and be difficult, I was glad I didn't though and through accepting the situation as it was and not being difficult I managed to get hold of something that was even more than I'd hoped for in the beginning. For me, once again, an important lesson in both patience and humility. The world doesn't revolve around me or my wishes, by taking things as they come and accepting the situation as it is, I open myself for completely new things I'd neither expected nor hoped for.
I founded Naadyn (old bandname Tape3000) in 2007. All songs are written and produced by myself. I started to learn some programs and composed melodies with a synthesizer (Microkorg). Over the years my music changed and I finally found what my sound should be like. I still record melodies, work a lot to find the right arrangement and add my voice. But the way how I produce my songs is basically the same: Sitting in my room, dim light, a computer and a synthesizer, some chocolate, three cats and a night that becomes a day.

Hola from Peru! We are the May Peru trip leaders Jess and Holly. We have had an incredible first few days and are excited to have started placements. We have had the wonderful opportunity of being able to watch the participants experience new relationships, new opportunities, and immerse themselves in the Peruvian culture. This week we are working on the construction of a daycare in Pacifico de Villa, as well as assisting at Laura Alva Saldana; a school for children with exceptionalities, and teaching English to children at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey schools. I (Jess) have been working at Laura Alva Saldana with four participants, where I would assist them with communicating with the teachers and students. While I (Holly) have been working at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey, assisting participants as they teach children English at the primary and secondary level. We would like to turn it over to a few of our participants, as they will be sharing some of their experiences this week. We encourage you to follow along with us on our amazing journey.

Since I began the adventure by heading east, I guess the other part of the hammer will be further westward, so start inkling that way. I briefly lose my page, causing my character to undergo great confusion - "WTF, a dragon?! Two orcs!? A dude showing me his bicep?!" before coming to his senses and finding a well. I chuck a gold piece in, wishing for more gold, but nothing happens.

I am writing this awkwardly with one of my cats on the desk half lying on the key board – a favourite position of his I wouldn’t dream of interfering with. His sister prefers to watch television. I have been answering emails (tardily – post a virus and subsequent new laptop) from many of you through both the blog and the website and I am just amazed at the interest in Christian and the emotion he still generates. Please keep sending me stories about your own animals, or YouTube links of cats (or dogs!), or what Christian means to you. I’m sure we are building an invaluable archive.

As with most right wing thinking, austerity is born from a lack of thought. It is a simple fact that cutting services means fewer jobs and raising taxes means people are worse off. The more unemployed you have the greater the drain on the economy, as the Government has to pay benefits but receive no taxes. The unemployment benefit is so laughable that people on it can’t usually spend anything outside of the basics, and so the economy loses out on sales, and the government loses out on VAT. Next, because the media constantly tells us we are in recession again, those people with jobs save their money. When they don’t spend, the shops lose out and in the worst cases have to enter insolvency, thus throwing another group of people out into unemployment. Cut, paste, repeat.
I'm not a very "in the moment" person. My head is usually recreating the past into ever rolling reinvented versions of the future. On the "Meyers Brigg", if you are familiar with that personality type tool, I'm an extreme "N', iNtuitive, living in the world of possibilities and connections, and not at all Sensing, grounded in reality and concrete things. The only time I get peace from my mind is when I run. There is something about the simple awareness of lungs, heart and muscle connecting with air and ground. Noticing the adrenaline kicking in and lifting my old joints into fluidity. Feeling the sun prickle my skin as the sweat rises. (In California. In Scotland it was the biting, icy wind). It was training for this event last year that reignited my dormant running addiction, and I feel quite satisfied that I'm going into it this year feeling strong and trained.

The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is another act that was passed to take away freedom and security in the United States and is in total violation of the constitution. As all the requirements of these acts become implemented, the people of the country will learn first-hand how it feels to have absolutely no freedom. These and other laws and regulations on the books will, when implemented, convert the United States into a more ruthless police state than was Nazi Germany or communist Russia and Red China.

What I really loved about this recipe though is that you prepare it the night before and it's all ready to go the next morning. Brilliant! I adore waffles on the weekend but sometimes I just want to sit with my coffee and relax rather than make a big breakfast. It was so nice to plug in the waffle iron and have a steamy hot fluffy waffle on my plate a few minutes later. Love this and will definitely make again!
That’s brilliant!
Hi everyone, how have you all been? A bit of a special one today... here we have a double feature post consisting of two manis using a spectraflair franken I made. A little backstory behind this franken is that I actually bought the pigment from a seller online who has been providing the special rainbow magic to tons of us in the nail polish community. Sadly, I heard that he recently passed away. These manis are a thank you to Sid - you will be missed! Thanks for providing us with endless possibilities to create some awesome polishes and enjoy what we love! =D
I used to enjoy shopping a lot more than I do today. I don't know if it is because I seldom find anything to get excited about, there is little I need, things seem too expensive, and or shopping like so many other activities just ain't as much fun as it used to be. It seems there is an avalanche of junk all made in China sitting around the stores, awaiting the reach of the shopper. Really, things used to be much more interesting, at least that's how I remember it. Like this photo of an ornate wire type bottle with a little grill plate on which one can write a note, and into which one can put corks from the wine bottles. Really. But to carry this absurdity farther, this cork holder is $29, which you can see in the description in the upper left corner. Seriously, who would spend $30 on that? Obviously someone because it is a featured item at a little local gift boutique where I browse from time to time.
For now, I think that I’m going to try them. I am going to make a run out to Tempe, to a shop that specializes in derby gear. It’s run by a couple of guys that skate in a men’s league. They know their stuff, and according to Ruthie, are great at working with all levels of skater. I’m hoping to get some pointers and one more reason to do this.
I was reading a thriller the other day, one of those convoluted stories with a dozen endings as if the author couldn’t figure out which ending he wanted to use. There were three crimes, all dealing with the same group of people yet none of the crimes were related. One of the crimes was a kidnapping, and though I know who did the kidnapping, the story was so complicated I still don’t know who instigated it. Despite all the flaws of the book, the one thing that took me out of the story was a typo. The author tried to set the scene using smells — the aroma of an expensive cigar, the smell of leather chairs, the scent of Channel Number 5 lingering in the air.

When her parents are murdered before her eyes, sixteen-year-old Helen Cartwright finds herself launched into an underground London where a mysterious organization called the Dictata controls the balance of good and evil. Helen learns that she is one of three remaining angelic descendants charged with protecting the world's past, present, and future. Unbeknownst to her, she has been trained her whole life to accept this responsibility. Now, as she finds herself torn between the angelic brothers protecting her and the devastatingly handsome childhood friend who wants to destroy her, she must prepare to be brave, to be hunted, and above all to be strong, because temptation will be hard to resist, even for an angel.

Two scenes from this movie fucked me up. First of course is the snake eating scene, that even in my "hey I'll try anything you can eat once" demeanor, I can't help but gag. Top that lovely scene with the rats in the water and you'd already have a winner. But no, they weren't satisfied with that and had to go and show me how the bad guy would rip a man's living heart out only to be tossed to the fire or some other overkill that just wasn't necessary. For an adult it was obviously fake, for a kid, well let's just say that voodoo juju isn't my idea for a good betimme story.
The simplicity of the measure is that if that a plot and you know its size then you can multiply one by the other and produce the allowable gross floor area of the scheme. For example if you have a site with a FAR of two you could build on half the site to four storeys, on one quarter of it to eight stories; in the absence of any other controls.

Why not just find the cookie she's really craving and spend her allotted calories on a truly delicious experience?

However, there are a few more things to Poland that it's women :)

Making people feel like a child, and using words that depict them as children, has been a favorite way to demean and belittle people and show everyone that this group is below the normal “adult” parts of society. This immediately sets the stage for that group of the society to be treated below the other parts of society. When this happens, it becomes ok to mistreat, demean, destroy, and otherwise commit violence on this group because they are children who need to be put in their place.
Rudyard Kipling achieved fame quickly, based initially on his first stories and poems written in India (he returned there after College), and his great popularity with the British public continued despite subsequent critical reaction to some of his more conservative work, and critical opinion in later years that his poetry was superficial and lacking in depth of meaning.

Direct taxation has been reduced for the super-rich, and there has been a rise in the general tax allowance. Isn't allowance an interesting word? Yes, the Establishment have decided that we are 'allowed' to keep a little more of our own money; brazenly stating that they have control over our money! This rise in the untaxed 'allowance' is immediately wiped out by a massive rise in the cost of petrol and diesel. In the topsy-turvy UK, there are no measures to discourage employers employing people not living locally, so commuting is a fact of life for most people. The increase in fuel 'duty' (again, an interesting word!) simply transfers the money not stolen by direct taxation, to theft by indirect taxation. Considering the cost of fuel, the result of the two measures is to rob the people of more of our money, whilst appearing to take less. To emphasise this theft, fuel duty increases this week, but the tax allowance does not rise for a full twelve months.

That said, when I go back and think about how the film was edited, I’d be hard-pressed to say what I would add back in while keeping the violence level toned down — not a lot of gore in the film as opposed to the book — and the film at a reasonable length.

If the book had fulfilled the promise it showed in the beginning, I might have given it five stars, but it has several serious flaws. One, as I have pointed out above, is its didacticism verging on propaganda for an oppressive regime. Another is that there are some serious unexplained plot holes.

I say ‘my’. In fact, I suspect this is something we’ve all had to begrudgingly figure out at some point or other, regardless of the bullshit behind it being lower-cased or title-cased. I suppose it’s just that, with the big-B’d Bullshit, finding yourself ribbon-tangled in a number of hugely conflicting emotions at any one time is less an occasional nuisance of a lesson learned than a baffling mindfuck of a rammed-down-your-throat crash-course exam-retake in genetics from a Klingon-speaking Amy Childs.

A couple of weeks ago my writing took a bit of a blow; having had a spectacular start to the masters course with A+ grades and general good feelings about my work coming from most angles, I decided to take some risks with my subject matter and style. I thought I had stepped up my game, I felt my prose had taken on a poetic aspect and I was writing the strange, macabre tales I would love to read. But, without any prior notice, my grade dropped rather significantly. Perhaps the risks were a mistake, or perhaps the process of marking creative writing will always be a subjective practice no matter how greatly objectivity is pursued. Either way I didn’t take the criticism very well. I called my friends who met me immediately in the pub for five hours of Articulate (possibly the best board game ever) and copious amounts of cloudy cider. Hugging the toilet bowl the following morning, a promise I had made myself a few years ago not to turn to alcohol in times of rejection/massive self-pity resurfaced. A little too late maybe, but I reaffirmed it that day all the same.

The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit…. And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction”.

You can tell almost immediately that Harber (who also penned the Eddie Romero-directed flick The Kidnappers and an episode of "Hawaii 5-0") had a copy of "Island Of Lost Souls" sitting by his typewriter as he knocked out this script. After all, when you have an island, an evil and/or mad scientist, experiments shrouded in secrecy and an unseen monster, there's every indication that you're not watching an original work. Yes, this is a story that has been done time and again, and would be done even more times than here (shall we flash-forward to 1977 and 1996, anyone? No? Wise choice.) and this isn't even the worst example of this retelling. At least they do us the honor of not giving us a title like H.G. Wells' Terror Is A Man or a subtitle like Terror Is A Man: Island Of Lost Souls. Points for integrity, guys.

Born Virginia Hensley and referred to by her family as “Ginny”, Patsy Cline displayed a talent for performing as early as the age of 4, when she won first prize in an amateur tap-dancing contest. It was not long afterward that she transferred her enthusiasm from dance to music, and for her eighth birthday Ginny’s mother bought a piano to provide her with a means to develop her natural musical skills. By her early teens she was singing in the choir of the family’s Baptist church and on her own at the local radio station. At the age of 13 the young girl’s life was nearly brought to end by an attack of rheumatic fever, which forced her to spend a period in an oxygen tent; she would later attribute the quality of her voice to the throat infection that resulted from her illness. Two years later her father abandoned the family and Ginny was forced to drop out of school, taking night jobs singing at clubs in addition to service jobs during the day in order to help pay the bills.

The children were (and still are) disappointed that the heated outdoor pool is only open seasonally (still not sure which season) and that the wifi is spotty at best – the teenagers are having the roughest time with this!
This, though, is a nice bit of perspective: "Whole Foods has always been a synthesis of healthy foods and foods for pleasure. ... Over our history, it seems, in 10-year cycles, one of those waxes and the other wanes. When we began, we were healthy foods. Around 1991, we began to evolve to food as pleasure. Now, food as health is beginning to wax again. It's not that we'll stop selling pleasurable foods. But we'll put greater emphasis on food as a health product."
i for one LOVE jumpsuits they are so effortless and just take the thought out of getting dressed in the morning cos its a 2in1, top with an attached bottom piece! i recommend everyone purchase a jumpsuit (you can thank me later.. in Drakes voice..) and i dare you not to love it! this can also be jazzed up with accessories.
The trend that "Shutter Island" seems to be chasing is what I now call the Big Twist Narrative that seems to have plagued horror films and thrillers for the last ten years. The narratives often function as a series of twists, fakeouts and gotcha moments building to an ending designed to make you slap your head and proclaim "Holy crap! I didn't see that coming!" Who knew Rod Serling would become one of the most influential writers of our time? Most would obviously point to M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" as the Ground Zero moment when filmmakers started making movies that resembled feature-length Twilight Zone episodes. I do believe that is a bit unfair, as I still consider both the Twist in "Sense" and the story that precedes it to still be justified as a narrative about human emotions. Besides, the emotional climax of that movie was always the final scene between main character Cole Sear and his mother in the car.
Q: Have you really lived “magnificently”?
But 40% of those deemed ineligible are appealing against their ruling, with more than a third of them successfully overturning the verdict – which has led to a call for more judges to process the caseload. Current figures suggest that the cost of these additional judges will be at least £1 million a year.
But it was shot down. Do you have any idea of the number of bizarre resolutions and bills the throw out there every year? It is insane! And the names. The Reform Education to Produce Future Leaders Act---there was one like that. My wording may be slightly off, but definitely not exaggerated. My version would be toned down, if anything.
Next we see Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) signing drugs out of the evidence room in New York. Meanwhile an Italian gangster Rossi (Jon Polito) talks with Frank at a restaurant, explaining that Trupo and his men are seizing their drugs, cutting them down, and selling them back. They both agree that things are different with Bumpy not around to make sure no one bothers them. Rossi supplies Frank with drugs and we see some of the chaotic events going on due to Bumpy's absence. Rossi exclaims that order is needed.
For the image panel, I've chosen the "Bells and Boughs" stamp set from Stampin' Up. I love the vintage look of these stamps. The image was colored with Cherry Cobbler, Garden Green and Hansome Hunter inkpads using a Dove blender pen. A bit of Mustard color ink was used to outline the image and make it pop. The panel was distressed using Tea Dye and Old Paper distress ink from Tim Holtz. A bit of yellow stickles to highlight the flower centers and a few silver rhinestone embellishments and that's it.
Okay, it doesn't have the same prestige of a Newbery or National Book Award sticker, but I can't imagine anyone not smiling at this new sticker that mocks the design of the Caldecott Award and announces that the book it's attached to is "Caldecott Eligible."
I was pleased with how they came out.
Then we took a pedicab (my first such ride of the year and Marianne's second -- her first was in Peiking) uptown for the reception. I'd list all the major writers who put in an appearance, but there were so many I'd be sure to miss some. And writers are delicate creatures and easily offended.

The incident has raised concerns for the medical-marijuana community in California, particularly the Harborside Health Center, a regulated dispensary also based in Oakland, which also happens to be the largest in the World. Harborside has had various threats from the IRS over the last two years regarding its business conduct, documented in ‘Weed Wars’, a program broadcast on the Discovery Channel. Assessing the situation from afar it seems noticeable that the authorities chose to attack the university (instead of just a dispensary) – perhaps because of their free licence to spread information on private production of cannabis and profiteering as a business, rather than just selling and distributing the drug. To try and determine the objectives of the authorities and federal agents who organised the raid, their concern on this front seems more understandable; the desire to exercise their power and eliminate personal usage whilst discrediting the facts and existing information.

I am writing this awkwardly with one of my cats on the desk half lying on the key board – a favourite position of his I wouldn’t dream of interfering with. His sister prefers to watch television. I have been answering emails (tardily – post a virus and subsequent new laptop) from many of you through both the blog and the website and I am just amazed at the interest in Christian and the emotion he still generates. Please keep sending me stories about your own animals, or YouTube links of cats (or dogs!), or what Christian means to you. I’m sure we are building an invaluable archive.

Society encourages us to think of boobs as somehow separate from the woman they’re attached to, is the problem. For men this probably makes life easier – they can enjoy staring at boobs without feeling awkward, because they can turn off their awareness of the woman the boobs are attached to. But for women it creates massive cognitive dissonance, because it’s bizarre to think of part of yourself as essentially disembodied. And for women who’re bi it’s even weirder, because we have the same “stare at boobs” impulse as straight men do, but we also know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of the stare.
It was one of those night.

And now Sarwat is back, with the sequel to Devil’s Kiss, DARK GODDESS. Devil’s Kiss was a page-turning read but DARK GODDESS! Wow! I think Sarwat has surpassed himself in terms of both style and story. His writing oozes with confidence and atmosphere. If you like your stories dark, action-packed and a real page-turning read you’ll love this book.
Sometimes they don’t even look at my face at all. Especially some men. They “talk” to my chest. I hate that. But then, people do tell us who they are, don’t they? These are some of the things that have caused me to envy my less endowed sisters.
As we were leaving the appointment we received an awesome, unexpected blessing. I had already climbed into the backseat of the car with Nora. William was about to get in when a woman parked next to us rolled down her window. “Excuse me,” she said, “I just wanted to let you know that we’ve been praying for you!” She had never met us, only recognized us from the blog, yet boldly decided to speak out. By doing so she completely made our day! We had permanent smiles etched on our faces at yet another example of just how many lives little Nora has touched. Thank you, Jennifer for your courage in saying something to us and for praying for us! That was awesome!

Three weeks away and much as changed. Spring has snuck into Nordkapp. To visitors traveling through, they may disagree. The temperature hovers between 0º- 6º C (32º-45ºF), and snow covers a large portion of the ground. But for those who live here, we can breath in the scent of damp soil and feel a hint of warmth in the breeze.

But it’s through Elizabeth’s eyes that we can get a semblance of how these events affect her and her siblings. Elizabeth was a bright, young girl. She studied with the best professors and was often ages ahead of everybody else when it came to education. At the beginning of her life she was a doted upon child, who received every pleasure that her mother and father could provide to her. But with the death of her mother, she was rendered a bastard, and her titles taken away. No only that, but she was no longer given the care that she deserved and at one point in her young life was forced to go without clothing. She was in exile. Following Henry’s marriage to Catherine Parr, he reinstated her into his will, as the third successor to the throne, following Edward VI and her older sister Mary. This was a happy time in her life, she was the apple of her father’s eye, being so much like him. Her position in life was stable and she had good relationships with her siblings. But everything changed with the death of her father, and her brother Edward VI’s succession to the throne. It should be noted that during this time the new religion has held strong. The story of this period of Elizabeth’s life became much of a struggle revolving around religion. Her brother was Protestant, her sister Catholic. Both of their reigns were blemished with religious competition and the will to bring their religion to the people. Mary’s reign was very difficult for Elizatbeth, not only due to their religious differences but also due to Elizabeth’s involvement in plots against Mary. But finally following a series of maladies disguised as pregnancies to Mary, she died and Elizabeth was given the throne. There starts the reign of Elizabeth, one of the longest-serving Queens/Kings ever. She became the virgin Queen, to never marry, she became one of England’s greatest rulers. Commanding both respect and fear.

The horror, oh the horror. Here I was rushing through some movies to catch any 2011 movies I watched, and then I stumbled upon three movies that took the wind from my sails.

Another night as I walked home from the subway the long-setted sun had left the sky dark, but some high-flying clouds in the eastern sky were still burning faintly with an orange glow. The sun’s light had refracted around our world and illuminated the floating vapour in an illusive light. I realized that the description of why it was happening was less beautiful than the fact that it was. So I stopped and looked up at the cool-orange glow and thought about nothing.
#738 - Tabu, A Story of the South Seas (1931) - (#228 on TSPDT) This Muranu film (co-directed of sorts with Robert Flaherty), the director's final film, released just after his death, is the highest ranked film in this update, and for the most part (excepting the two Renoir and Flaherty's own Louisiana Story) deserves to be. A fascinating look at tribal culture and law in the form of a tragic romance. History tells us that Flaherty was not happy with Murnau's screenplay - calling it too westernized - but even with this dissent, the combination of the German auteur's directorial prowess and Flaherty's naturalistic filmmaking style, make for a surprisingly intriguing work of cinematic art. I suppose considering this is a film from these two men, I should not be all that surprised at its bravura standing.
I'm so glad you gave it a go.

The basic premise of all three movies is that corporal punishment is used to discipline female inmates in prison. The first movie begins with a prisoner (Dominika) rejecting the sexual advances of a guard (Kelly, who appears in all three movies). Kelly retaliates by reporting to the Sergeant of the Guard that she has been attack by the prisoner. Of course, such acts are not to be tolerated so Dominika is brought to the guard house where she is bent over a table, bound by her wrists and her skirt is raised. Her punishment begins with a leather strap but this doesn't last long. Next, her legs are bound to the table legs and her punishment continues with the cane. The caning is 24 strokes, by my count, and it lasts over 5 minutes in the movie. It is shown from several camera angles but one is partially obstructed by a cement wall or post.

But this is what I did, and my bathroom was cleaner then than it is now that I have lots of time: I used that playing time (and you really only need five minutes) to get the toilet scrubbed, wiped down, and dried off. Then, since I've used the sink for my water supply, I clean that, using a different sponge, and rinse and dry it off. (Use rag towels for drying.) Wipe off the mirror.

Dad said nothing. He put the tree to the side of the house and went off again to find another one. This went ahead every year. Dad would find a tree and bring it back for Mom’s approval. It usually took three or four attempts before Mom decided she liked the first one best. Dad would then strip some boughs from the others before putting them on the wood pile. He bored holes in the trunk of the Christmas tree and inserted the extra boughs to fill it out.

Everything centers around the Solo children, especially Anakin, who plays a major role in the finale. We get to see how he works and why he works, his interactions with his siblings.

Farrow, however, was a destructive force on another level. As her modeling career faded, she is alleged to have transitioned into the role of drug kingpin, becoming the world's least-clad meth-dealer and shipping drugs mixed with bath salts from her Hollywood home to the far corners of the Earth. In 2009, the DEA moved in to arrest her, and she went on the lam, adding 19 more aliases to her list of names. She has been arrested twice this year in Australia, once in February (after which she promptly skipped bail), and again yesterday.
Well, I’ll tell you the truth: it beats me! However, I’m not ashamed to admit that Stan Madeley is my kind of man: fearless when the circumstances call for it but with a dash of the romantic when his wife Sandra (54) hits the dimmer switch. He’s also the UK’s top Richard Madeley lookalike and a trained cabaret chisel thrower to boot, so you don’t need me to point out that he’s blessed on more than one front.
Stan might also be making the connection that his mafia friends are not so friendly after all. This season has been better so far with the exception of us following the politician, which is a bit boring. I’m assuming he must still be connected in some way, perhaps his rival will be linked to it all, and he will be involved in uncovering it, thus redeeming his professional reputation.

The abdominals weaken and lengthen during pregnancy, and I’m specifically talking about the six-pack muscle which runs from your breastbone, to your pubic bone, vertically down the front of your stomach. Sometimes these muscles separate, but not in all pregnancies. The deep, internal abdominal muscle called the Transverse Abdominis, sometimes referred to as your “core” muscle should be your main focus. Sit ups aren’t suitable for postnatal women to do, so stop them immediately if you are, and neither are forceful rotational movements where you twist your torso from right to left. It’s safer to perform Pilates-based exercises which target the pelvic floor and deep abdominal muscles or “core”, as these help stabilise your pelvis and the exercises themselves have numerous benefits.
I see in Forrest Gump the most important qualities for a man to success: faith and persistence. He firmly believes in what he is doing and does everything with his full capacity. When he was young, he was only good at was running. He also enjoyed it. So he ran at his best and got into the football team, which later led him into college. In the Vietnam war, he followed the Lieutenant faithfully and treated him sincerely, which earned him a valuable lifelong friendship. Moreover, he was able to retreat when he could not fight through. He memorized Jenny’s words well: “Never try to be brave”. When one’s in overwhelming danger, the most optimal strategy is indeed saving up one’s energy for a better future.

It's not perfectly accurate nor entirely fair to those early utopians to call them socialists or Communists. They had a vision of a "good society" that they hoped to achieve by departing from the prevailing norms. Why they thought they could improve on conditions in the larger society around them isn't easy to determine. Though their experiments failed to provide the results they sought, the ideas they germinated did not fail to find supporters and promulgators.
Max Tegmark, astrophysicist, cosmologist and professor in the physics faculty at MIT in Cambridge, Mass likes the idea of parallel universes: the quantum mechanics (QM) paradox of a particle’s ability to be in two places at the same time. He sees mathematics as our ultimate connection to reality. “Math is not something we invented, but something we are continually rediscovering.”

On the afternoon of Monday, January 8, 1912, Mrs. Grace Johnson, the director of the Springfield Museum of Natural History and Miss Fannie Stebbins, the supervisor of natural science for the Springfield School Department, assembled a group of amateur bird watchers and organized the Springfield Bird Club. The purpose of the club was “to attract, conserve and study birds.” A century later, the Allen Bird Club, as it soon came to be known, is still carrying out this original purpose.
2. We wanted a subtle gradation with the fuchsia so there was no hard line where the blonde ends and the pink begins. Using a semi-permanent pink color + warm water we created 3 different strength pinks in 3 different bowls. (We used Special FX color in Atomic Pink. Put 2 quarter sized dabs of color in each bowl. Add 1/2 a cup of warm water to one bowl, 1 cup of warm water to the second bowl and 1 1/2 cups of warm water to the third bowl.)

Given the amount of financial stimulation that the Fed has pumped into the economy with limited apparent impact along with the recently stated willingness to do even more raises a fairly large red flag. While such action may keep interest rates artificially low, they have been at these low levels for some time with little economic improvement to show for it given the magnitude of the cash infusion. This is much like has been the case for decades in Japan. While these low rates may force savers to abandon fixed income to buy equities in search of a better return, to me this inflation of the stock market is artificial (although as the saying goes it is difficult to fight the tape).

As part of this pre-budget series, I am going to ‘take stock’ of some recent, significant happenings in relevant areas.
This book discusses the animal zodiac and tries to explain some of the different animals. Ahead of time, I check to see which year each child was born (you think they would know, but many don't!). I tell them which animal they are and we discuss some of the characteristics. They always get a kick out of this part-- and they want to know which animal their brother, sister, mama, and daddy are....
However, 2 of the days since I started the new size pages, I only got about one and two thirds of a page done. This is roughly equivalent of 2.5 – 3 pages in my old pad. I wasn’t slacking, I just ran out of time. So I’m going to count them as done anyway. I did the work.

Wow! That is a pretty big challenge. There is a reason it is called “the shadow”. It can be a bit scary to take an honest look at what we are feeling and why. Isn’t it easier to sit in judgment and blame someone else than to take 100% responsibility for our own thoughts and actions? Ya, I think so too! But I have realized in recent days, months, years that I need to take 100% accountability for everything that happened or continues to happen in my life. Whether it’s the abuse I endured as a child, the issues in my marriage, or what I perceive to be happening within the roller derby league I was practicing with. This book reiterates what I already believe and that is that “thoughts are things” and we create our own world based on our thoughts. When I think, “Well they don’t like me and are ignoring me and leaving me out because they don’t like me” then it sets that “wish” into motion and sure enough I get more of what I perceived to be true. This just shows me that I am feeling separate from others….separate from my self…separate from God/Love. Where there is separation, there is fear. Where there is fear, there is the shadow. Where there is shadow, there is dis-ease, pain, sadness.
Take the L train to Graham Ave. (Brooklyn!) Walking directions are as follows: Walk East on Metropolitan Avenue towards Humboldt. You want to get to Woodpoint Road, so you can do that by taking the awkward diagonal Maspeth Ave, which is definitely faster. If you miss it, just turn right on Conselyea Street. Turn left on Woodpoint, and walk walk walk northeast, until you hit Kingsland Ave, then turn left again. As you approach the not-so-sexy underbelly of the BQE, you should find the magic street Lombardy and turn right! Walk on Lombardy until you hit 171 Lombardy, and you've found it. If you feel like "uh, this is weird, there's like, nothing around here but warehouses and stuff," you're totally in the right place! You should see our doorman hanging around by the door.

We all had so much fun working on our very pink dress up inspiration shoot. It was (for me) the first time working with children in multiples, which could have ended up going in any direction really. It was all good, although there was a teeny petulant area when they got to the table and found out they would have to wait another three minutes before they were actually allowed to eat the pretty cakes :)

This week over on Nutshells we have another great challenge for you all. This time we are asked to do a card using polka dots and/or stripes. It was great fun. I love dots and stripes so this wasn't much of a "challenge" for me...I use them all the time. This little cutie is from the Nutcrafter site. It is one of my first from them but I love her she makes me think of a retro, hip gal. I hope you all can join us this week. There will be a special mystery prize for this challenge and you will have 2 weeks to enter.
Thankfully the cold spell has relented and Friday will see the brewery fired up for the first time in 2012. My only reservations are that I'm out for a few beers on the Thursday evening, so I might well have a sore head when the time comes to switch on the HLT, which will be pretty early as I like to get finished while there's still daylight. The second reservation is the pump.

What I really loved about this recipe though is that you prepare it the night before and it's all ready to go the next morning. Brilliant! I adore waffles on the weekend but sometimes I just want to sit with my coffee and relax rather than make a big breakfast. It was so nice to plug in the waffle iron and have a steamy hot fluffy waffle on my plate a few minutes later. Love this and will definitely make again!

Then it was back on the bus for drive to lunch. I'm not sure if the driver followed the "official" route, because he took us through a local neighborhood that didn't look like it saw a lot of traffic. When we got to the restaurant, we got another small glass of punch, then there was a man taking snapshots of each party before before they were seated. The buffet lunch included salad, jerk chicken, pork, mutton with potatoes, rice pasties, and several kinds of cookies and pastries for dessert.

As regular readers of my blog will be aware, I have a weakness for American cop shows, despite the, diversity quota approved, parallel universe of evil white criminals and honest, law abiding, black victims in which they are set.

Add 1 tbsp oil to large non-stick stock pot (I used my Mario Batali Dutch Oven) over med-high heat. Brown chicken, about 2 minutes per side, and then remove. Add 1 tbsp oil, fennel and onion to same skillet. Sauté until golden brown in spots and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Return chicken to pot, add broth and lemon juice. Bring to simmer, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until chicken is cooked through and sauce begins to thicken, about 20 minutes. Stir in cilantro just before serving, and add salt and pepper to taste.
However, at the height of her newly-found fame, when preparing a show in Berlin, she feels sabotaged. Years of envy and jealousy, some of them of the amorous persuasion, perhaps, seem to have found too palpable an expression. And the challenge is the ultimate one when, just one year later, an attempt, which may well be successful in its aim, is made on her life.

I like to listen to Dave Ramsey. I find him to be very encouraging, not only about money, but about life in general. I’d also like to change my view, my family history of money. I don’t want to think of myself as poor. Just because my parents were in debt, and their parents before them, even if they weren’t in debt, were at least very poor, doesn’t have to mean that I can’t be successful financially in my life.

On the bright side, I did find some great deals this morning. There was a fabulous Got2B hair products promotion going on. If you bought one for $5.99, you got a second one free. I still had a bunch of $3/1 MQs left, so I bought a bunch of the hairspray. My daughter LOVES this stuff! There was one Got2B product on clearance for $3.29 also. So I purchased 4 hairsprays and the root growth product. I got 5 products for 29 cents!!!

Danesbury Hill is lovely to walk along. We saw four different types of butterflies : chalk blue, marbled white, red admiral and an orange one I have yet to identify. There were lots of flowers, including self-heal, clover, yellow vetches, forget-me-nots and some yellow ones which I didn’t know what they were. There were also two ponies grazing the land. I think I saw a medlar tree, but since it’s the first I’ve seen I need to check it in my identification books. Medlars are unique in that the fruits of the tree are only edible when they are rotten.
I asked my son (the one with an “o,” not a “u”) what he thought about the sun. Daniel responded “meh,” which the dictionary defines as “an expression of apathy, indifference, or boredom.”

‘Medium Fish’ campaigns I refer to as the ‘default’, since it is where most D&D campaigns spend most of their time (anywhere from levels 5-15, arguably, and even broader if the GM gets clever). Since most RPGs take their cue from D&D on some level, this is where everybody lands. The advantages of the medium fish campaign are obvious: the PCs have enough power so that they feel awesome, but not so much power that the GM feels like he or she might lose control of the party (which, in itself, is a concern better addressed other ways, but I digress). Medium Fish are a good way to keep a campaign on the rails, so to speak, and to give PCs both a keen sense of mortality coupled with some fun opportunities for derring-do and frontal-assault type heroics.

Given the amount of financial stimulation that the Fed has pumped into the economy with limited apparent impact along with the recently stated willingness to do even more raises a fairly large red flag. While such action may keep interest rates artificially low, they have been at these low levels for some time with little economic improvement to show for it given the magnitude of the cash infusion. This is much like has been the case for decades in Japan. While these low rates may force savers to abandon fixed income to buy equities in search of a better return, to me this inflation of the stock market is artificial (although as the saying goes it is difficult to fight the tape).

And so we began at the scene of battle. A number of kobold corpses lay scattered about the ruined well house. One of the kobolds was still gasping for air, and makes the mistake of trying to mock the heroes for their fruitless search for Ronnick, the villain of the story. The kobold spits out a mouthful of blood and broken teeth before giggling maniacally and shouting “Ha, you took the bait! Now Ronnick can make it to his real hide out at Dragontooth Hill.” After a pause, the kobold realizes he gave away important information, but it is too late. He is tied up, interrogated, and finally, a magic missile by Faverel puts an end to his torment. As the kobold perishes with a smoking hole in his forehead, he shrugs and has one last gem of wisdom to offer. “Oh well, I had it coming.”

"It could only happen on Top Of The Pops - it's classical guitar" If you like, Jimmy. "Where could you get such class except Top Of The Pops?" rhetorically asks a man who chose to dress like that. Both parties sit, the crowd stand pensively around the perimeter of a small circular stage I don't think we've ever seen before. It's pretty much what you'd expect Feelings performed by Cleo Laine with John Williams to sound like, a reminder that throughout this decade you'd get stuff well out of the pop loop - the Shadows were regulars well into the 80s - in an attempt to paint the show as inclusive and classy. The response is appropriately Two Ronnies audience-like.

5. Road trip. I’ve been thinking about this one for quite some time. I don’t know how feasible this is, especially since I’ll be working full time, but I’d like to make some road trips east over a couple weekends or so. I’ve always been interested in experiencing the other parts of America (especially non-coastal states), because I feel there is a vast disconnect between coastal and non-coastal states. I would ideally get a lot of driving done on awesome roads, see lots of interesting sights, and learn new things. Not sure if I want to go it alone or bring along some friends. Friends are always fun, but I think solo trips bring in a completely different experience, which could be good for me as well. I guess we’ll see!

As we were leaving the appointment we received an awesome, unexpected blessing. I had already climbed into the backseat of the car with Nora. William was about to get in when a woman parked next to us rolled down her window. “Excuse me,” she said, “I just wanted to let you know that we’ve been praying for you!” She had never met us, only recognized us from the blog, yet boldly decided to speak out. By doing so she completely made our day! We had permanent smiles etched on our faces at yet another example of just how many lives little Nora has touched.

It must be that time of year because I know a lot of people who are in need of a get well card...everything from the stomach bug to broken bones. So I decided to use the cheerful Oops-a-Daisy set to create a simple set of Get Well cards. I started by matching up the ink colors to the Jillibean Homemade 6 Bean Soup patterned paper. I stamped the flowers in Colorbox Yellow Citrus, Maroon, Rouge, and Prima Turquoise Stone. Then I cut out the flower with the coordinating Oops-a-Daisy die. I cut ovals with the Spellbinders oval set and airbrushed inside the die line with Copics. I stamped the stem and leaves with Colorbox Lime Pastel ink and then popped the daisy up on foam tape. I wanted to keep it really simple so I just layered onto a scalloped oval and added a little ribbon to finish them off.

You may ask, then, why I have chosen a ball perched atop a steep hill to represent the very foundation of contemporary society. I make no claims of any great knowledge in neurology, psychology, anthropology, or sociology, but there is one characteristic of our society that my own observations have repeatedly led me to: this hill, this very foundation, is unstable. At any point, a small amount of force applied in the right direction can start the ball rolling back down, back to stable ground, to the agrarian, community-based economics practiced for so much of human history. A small shift in day-to-day life, or the rediscovery of a older, simpler tradition that, in the hustle and bustle of modern life, we didn’t realize we had forgotten – these little events on a societal or, more likely, personal level, can start the ball rolling. Moreover, if strong enough, they can completely derail all of the artificiality, materialism, and vice which have been forced upon us (by whom?: that is a whole discussion in itself), in order to separate us from our roots and keep us in a state of near-subservience.

Discipline in schools is important to ensure a positive learning environment for all. I think clear, applicable, and relevant policies outlining behaviors and consequences is one way to ensure students and teachers feel safe to learn. These policies should be school (and perhaps even district) wide, applied consistently, and be fair to all students. Every student has the right to learn in a safe and secure environment and teachers deserve to teach in safe and secure schools.

Before you write your book title, make a list of all related keywords and perform a search on Google to see what comes up in the results. Also, when you do your search, the first page shown should have a short list of other suggested keywords or phrases (usually at the very top or bottom of the page). Incorporating as many of these words into your book title as is possible will help your book be seen better in the future.

Bottom Line: HAUNTING VIOLET was there, and I read it. That pretty much sums up my feelings for it. However, looking at other reviews, it seems HAUNTING VIOLET is one of those books that's either meh or OMGAMAZING, with most people falling in the latter. So if you're an Alyxandra Harvey or ghostly mysteries fan, I recommend giving it a try. Not the right haunt for me, but maybe it will be for you.

Making people feel like a child, and using words that depict them as children, has been a favorite way to demean and belittle people and show everyone that this group is below the normal “adult” parts of society. This immediately sets the stage for that group of the society to be treated below the other parts of society. When this happens, it becomes ok to mistreat, demean, destroy, and otherwise commit violence on this group because they are children who need to be put in their place.

Oh well, it will be a good lesson for her on how to deal with situations she doesn't control.

#738 - Tabu, A Story of the South Seas (1931) - (#228 on TSPDT) This Muranu film (co-directed of sorts with Robert Flaherty), the director's final film, released just after his death, is the highest ranked film in this update, and for the most part (excepting the two Renoir and Flaherty's own Louisiana Story) deserves to be. A fascinating look at tribal culture and law in the form of a tragic romance. History tells us that Flaherty was not happy with Murnau's screenplay - calling it too westernized - but even with this dissent, the combination of the German auteur's directorial prowess and Flaherty's naturalistic filmmaking style, make for a surprisingly intriguing work of cinematic art. I suppose considering this is a film from these two men, I should not be all that surprised at its bravura standing.
I ran and ran and ran and waited and waited and waited for the vibration. All you Garmin users are asking yourself WHY I didn’t just look at my Garmin and see where the mileage was at, right? I know you are. It’s okay. I’m not offended. The fact is that I don’t like to watch the mileage tick off, which is one of the reasons I love the 610. I don’t have to! I can swipe my screen and have the time showing (or the virtual partner, which I have to figure out how to adjust because that dude runs at a 9:05 pace and I will never catch him). I prefer to have the clock face showing because it’s more important that I get back to my house by 5:30 than what pace or how far I’ve run.
I hope you enjoy the blog, and please comment and tell me how right I am for my various reviews. First up is what I did for my Winter Vacation, the lovely state of Maryland awaits.

This is an almost-after shot of my new-to-me rattan furniture.

Moore says building strategic partnerships enables companies to work through challenging markets and fast-track overall success. “As a CEO, I see it as part of my job to be a super connector, networking with the technology and investment community without an expectation of reciprocation. Partnerships forged through time, trust, and mutual benefit–such as those Axcient has built with HP, Ingram-Micro, and a vast network of service providers and resellers–are the types of community relationships that bring about the greatest returns.”
Hawking suggested black holes were places in the cosmos which swallowed everything. Nothing escapes after it has breached the rim — event horizon — of a black hole. All light, matter, energy, information is sucked in by its (theoretical) huge gravitational pull and is lost. Nothing comes back out.

"I think Wall Street hasn't taken in how much anger there is out there and they haven't taken partial responsibility for the financial crisis," says Brookings Institution fellow Douglas Elliott, who was an investment banker for two decades before joining the liberal-oriented public policy group.

One of the things I love about the human heart is that it’s wired to help others when they’re in need. I see this repeated over and over: when a natural disaster strikes a town, or when a terrible wrong is committed against someone who’s done right, or when a beloved friend passes away. When people see a need, they often respond with caring hearts.

I have come to the conclusion that I was really more affected by that Barracuda eating Nemo's mum than I originally thought at the time and subconsciously I am creating a fish haven for all the orphaned Nemos of the world. Either that or I was a fish in another life and I am now surrounding myself with icons that remind me of the loved ones I left behind in that lifetime.
This lasted for a few moments before she came back to her senses. She then pulled her coat around her and stood to leave. The pigeon hopped politely to one side. She hadn't even noticed me. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, people rarely do. My teeth ground together as I felt the anger rising in me. I watched her leave, and made a split second decision to head after her. I hung back a bit, I didn't want her to notice me now. Not yet anyway.

Sadly anyone arriving at, well lets say a normal beer drinking hour (maybe you had lunch first and arrived at say 2pm), arrived to empty taps and long arse lines.

I have a new friend. I'll call him Adrian. Hello, Adrian - I'm sure you will recognise yourself, even with this different name. Adrian has written a long novel which he has been working on for much of this year. He has had feedback from several readers, some with publishing industry experience, so their comments are more likely to be useful than those of random friends and family. He has taken on board all their comments and made changes to his novel. I have not read his novel, nor do I intend to until it is published. I have read and commented on the synopsis and the first page - that's all. So can I be any use to Adrian in helping him develop his novel? I think so. Because I don't think I can teach him to write, but I might be able to help him to learn to write.

I thought that Fever had a much faster pace than Wither. There is never a dull moment as Rhine flits from one danger to the next in her quest to reach her home in Manhattan and reunite with her twin brother Rowan. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and wasn’t sure what was worse living a lie as Linden’s wife? Or acting as Madams puppet in her Carnival? Both lifestyles are equally as shocking and horrendous and I love that about Lauren DeStefano’s books, how she doesn’t shy away from tough topics. Whereas in book one we got to look at life as a bride this book takes a look into life as a prostitute which was as equally harrowing yet fascinating to read about. Although controversial topics, I think they add an extra layer of horror to the books and because of that make this future in particular one of the bleakest and cruellest I’ve read in dystopian fiction.

“The reign of the camera had begun. I cannot pretend that I was aware of the implications of my protracted Saturday afternoon communings with shadows flickering across a screen, but it is certainly true that, increasingly, when I emerged, what was outside took on the character of the pictures I had been looking at, rather than the other way round.

For the record, at this point let's see if we can't dig out the actual meaning of the term Mary-Sue. Because it did have a useful definition once, before it was co-opted and turned into a two-word mud-pie to diminish female characters. And that definition was this:

What really impresses me about fashion on the British high street is that it works really hard to be wantable. They rotate their stock every four to six weeks and can respond very quickly to new trends. Something like Mad Men: it’s on TV for a couple of months, it’s a very definitive fashion statement and the stores are always very reactive to that.

An important ( if logical) thing to remember is that if your php code is dodgy it will produce dodgy HTML, which means your site won’t be written in valid code.

Last week the husband and I traveled to Cabo San Lucas. The following entries will be some of my thoughts on the trip. (By the way, Cabo: very cool.)
Rea: Your first relationships are often the most intense and impressionable of your life. You’re not yet bombarded with paying bills or having a steady job – you can enjoy each other – you can focus on your feelings and not much else. As we grow older, this is what we often lose sight of: each other. This book reminds you of what’s important at any stage in relationships – focusing on what you appreciate about the person, not what annoys you.
I’m curious to see what you think. Would you rather read a series or a standalone? Which Midnight Guardian series book is your favorite?
And just as quickly as it comes, my "me time" is gone. Libby is asking for a vitamin, I give it to her. Then I sit again and she is moving my chair and wants something to eat, wants a kiss on her finger, wants my attention.
Oh yes, aren't these two beautiful? Hard to believe that, God willing, we get a whole additional one.

I think their orientation was changing. We were really into Tweez, we were totally obsessed with that record. When Spiderland came out, a bunch of us said, "oh, well, I don't know about this..." That's pretty well stood the test of time. I've heard that record a few too many times, for sure, but side one of that you can't even touch. It's just really spectacular. And they did that when they were 20? They were really young when they did that.
And if I need more reason to minimize those slip-ups, I can think about how great it was to try on a special favorite Halloween “spider” sweater that I bought years ago and kept just in case I slimmed down. It fits (yay!), and I’m looking forward to wearing it again for the holiday this year!
We checked into our hotel that evening and had dinner (thank you Aunt Roxie) in our rooms. The children were (and still are) disappointed that the heated outdoor pool is only open seasonally (still not sure which season) and that the wifi is spotty at best – the teenagers are having the roughest time with this!

Relationships: Whoever you are, you need a support system. Relationships are vital to your health. You need to lovingly weed those negative people out of your garden. Negativity is toxic. If you are eating raw organic vegan and jogging ten miles, and then going home and being verbally abused, your health is still going to suffer. Everyone has a responsibility to take care of her own garden. Bless those negative people and love yourself enough to extract yourself from that situation. If you need help, get it.

Martha and Cynthia were left with the two thousand pound cost of flying their Aunt’s body back home for burial, in addition to the debts she had racked up in the six years of travelling. It had not been a particularly good time. Still, if she was going to go, Martha thought, she’d like to go out with a bang; like frivolous Aunt Cece, only perhaps without the yellow pallor and translucent, wrinkled skin. Martha consoled herself that she didn’t look her age, and prayed that she could at least keep her good looks until the time came.
It should be a very quick dress up party for it. I personally detest these ceiling lights. They are uneventful... okay the word I'm looking for is BORING! but eh, some paint could dress it up fun if you go silver, black, red, imagine it in yellow, fuchsia... it's endless. =D

Wow! That is a pretty big challenge. There is a reason it is called “the shadow”. It can be a bit scary to take an honest look at what we are feeling and why. Isn’t it easier to sit in judgment and blame someone else than to take 100% responsibility for our own thoughts and actions? Ya, I think so too! But I have realized in recent days, months, years that I need to take 100% accountability for everything that happened or continues to happen in my life. Whether it’s the abuse I endured as a child, the issues in my marriage, or what I perceive to be happening within the roller derby league I was practicing with. This book reiterates what I already believe and that is that “thoughts are things” and we create our own world based on our thoughts. When I think, “Well they don’t like me and are ignoring me and leaving me out because they don’t like me” then it sets that “wish” into motion and sure enough I get more of what I perceived to be true. This just shows me that I am feeling separate from others….separate from my self…separate from God/Love. Where there is separation, there is fear. Where there is fear, there is the shadow. Where there is shadow, there is dis-ease, pain, sadness.
There’s a healthy balance between a questioning mind and a mind that will only be satisfied by the empirical approach. Opening the world of “Theology Proper” one may think that the more one reads the less questions one will have…not so in my case.However a correct understanding is imperative

What I really loved about this recipe though is that you prepare it the night before and it's all ready to go the next morning. Brilliant!

We went ringing at Al Ali Farm in the afternoon last weekend. I had only been ringing at this site once before and it looks like a great site. There are plenty of tall trees, shrubs and open fields and a lot of birds where about. In the trees we set three nets hoping to catch Rufous-tailed Scrub Robin and Common Redstart which were seen in good numbers as we were setting up the nets. We also hoped we could catch a few Ortolan buntings in the grass field as Brendan and Nicole had caught 21 birds there the weekend before in one attempt. As it turned out most of the Ortolan Buntings had moved on and plenty of House Sparrows were in the fields along with a number of Daurian Shrikes and Turkestan Shrikes. Abdulla came for an hour and hoped to catch a Lesser Grey Shrike that he had seen but it evaded the trap and was not caught. …

I say ‘my’. In fact, I suspect this is something we’ve all had to begrudgingly figure out at some point or other, regardless of the bullshit behind it being lower-cased or title-cased. I suppose it’s just that, with the big-B’d Bullshit, finding yourself ribbon-tangled in a number of hugely conflicting emotions at any one time is less an occasional nuisance of a lesson learned than a baffling mindfuck of a rammed-down-your-throat crash-course exam-retake in genetics from a Klingon-speaking Amy Childs.

I believe that the goal should change from making children happy and protecting them from harm to raising them to be independent adults able to problem-solve and cope in the real and sometimes difficult adult world. A safety net can become a trap. Dependence on one’s parents means lack of real security and often results in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It's nonsense. Someone has written another book about how kids these days never grow up, and how it's all the parents' fault for being too helpful, too involved, too available. Read more about it here. Apparently, parents need to set more boundaries, have higher expectations, force independence at a younger age. The goal of parenting should be independence instead of happiness?! Dependence leads to low self-esteem?! Security makes us feel insecure?! I disagree.
Also, I know that a couple of people asked me to keep them posted on how the zine was going, so I'll give a litle update on that! About 30 people have said they will, or probably will, contribute to the zine, which is really exciting! I've actually received 5 different things from 3 different people, and am hoping to get more stuff soon... ;-) So that's going well.

Democrats delivered for unions by exempting the first $27,500 of a straight family’s health plan from the “Cadillac tax” and delayed any taxation on those benefits until 2018. Gay individuals, parents and their children who receive their health insurance through their domestic partners pay income tax on dollar one of their benefits. This is a huge disparity in the treatment of gays and straights. It is also a hardship for middle and low-income gay families and an injustice for all gays. Lobbying to include domestic partners in the “Cadillac tax” exemption would have been smart, non-controversial and helped many in our community. Instead of making progress, by ignoring this opportunity we were left with the expansion of a discriminatory system.

He was known to be litigious, and had won a huge award from the Daily Star for libel in 1987. Lord Archer was a prominent and powerful man whose reputation, despite being chipped away at round the edges by Michael Crick and by Private Eye, was still very high.
The minutes before Katniss stepped into the "tube" that transported her up into the arena were amazing. Numerous closeups of Kat shaking like a leaf. Her eyes convey fear unlike anything I've ever seen in film...not even Carol Ann Freeling! You're scared right along with her.
The country that we love already exists; it's here, all around us. Fighting to keep something, to preserve our Constitution and our great nation, is far easier than fighting to take something away, to destroy and obliterate it. We have will, determination, American pride and ingenuity. We are the ones who thoroughly, to our marrow, understand the phrase "Give me liberty or give me death." This love of country, this patriotism, is not something you learn in a book, it's not something you ponder out of the ether while standing around in ice-cream coats and munching on fancy herring snacks. It is deep, it is enduring--it lives in us and is who we are.
Make sure the staff gets all the training they need: concepts and skills training, tools training, and process training. It won’t do them any good if they know what button to push but they don’t understand why they should push it. Training is an ongoing process; continue later with advanced training to broaden the staff’s knowledge and skills.
On the afternoon of Monday, January 8, 1912, Mrs. Grace Johnson, the director of the Springfield Museum of Natural History and Miss Fannie Stebbins, the supervisor of natural science for the Springfield School Department, assembled a group of amateur bird watchers and organized the Springfield Bird Club. The purpose of the club was “to attract, conserve and study birds.” A century later, the Allen Bird Club, as it soon came to be known, is still carrying out this original purpose.
Now to be fair, most of the press stories quoted above do make it clear that individual employers will still have a steep hill to climb in justifying forced retirement. You could pick fault here and there with the detail but there are lots of quotes from lawyers trying to explain the case in simple terms and emphasising that each case has to be judged on its own merits. Once you get past the headlines, I think the press have generally done a good job, all things considered.
So in conclusion, my “denomination” is everything aligned with the Word. I don’t need a fancy name or a huge building with the letters nailed across it. I am a Christian who believes that Jesus is my Lord and Savior, who died on the cross, resurrected, and is coming again (1 John 4:14, John 3:16, Matthew 18:7, Matthew 16:27). In simple terms, I reject anything that is not instructed and supported by God and His Word. We are the Church and the Holy Spirit dwells within us, what other definitions do we need?
I’m getting there and I highly recommend taking a pay cut.
The horror, oh the horror. Here I was rushing through some movies to catch any 2011 movies I watched, and then I stumbled upon three movies that took the wind from my sails. I’m now done, I’ve got my top ten list ready for 2011 and I will post it up on Saturday before the end of the year. So I’m guessing some of you out there are wondering what three movies destroyed
I mean, you don't have to be a rocket scientist. You can't make this shit up. My son was labeled autistic when he was 3 years old. The ONLY expert I listened to was Temple Grandin. She led me much more lovingly through trecherous waters than the psychiatrists Ben had. Except for the one who was ADHD himself. He used to tell my son he was the hardest worker he knew. And school is very, very hard for our kids who think differently, who think right-brained, visuallly, as some describe it. These Hunters in a Farmers world.

Back from Portland, and into the stream of consciousness that comes from sitting in an empty pub doing cleaning, maintenance and paperwork. A Subway sub and half pint of mild for lunch, a quick foray into the current blogroll (thanks again, Jeff - we need to open a proper real ale pub in Stumptucky), and some thoughts about spending some time in the city with the most breweries than any city in the world.

If you’ve ever used a condom before, you know that they actually have multiple uses…like balloon animals! Duhh! Durex takes these balloon animals to a whole new level. Yeah, this campaign is old, but its still funny to us. Enjoy. And if you’d like, here are some stills from the campaign.
You know all of those "free gift with purchase" deals and free samples that you get at department store make up counters? I'm not a hoarder, except for when it comes to this stuff. I have a whole drawer full of it. Most of it isn't even mine. My grandma, mom, and sisters send it to me. It makes for perfect play makeup!
So I carefully slid onto the vinyl seat of the telephone stand and gently lifted the receiver to my ear. I expected to hear the voice of one of Mom’s friends. But I didn’t recognize the voice at all.
When I remember back on things that make me feel guilty I tend to remember them as if I’m looking at myself from outside my body. It's a false sense of memory, perhaps a way to deal with the guilt. There are many things I don’t remember at all. My brother is good at telling me things I said years ago that I can't remember in any shape or form. Maybe I don't remember those because they didn’t make me feel guilty.

I founded Naadyn (old bandname Tape3000) in 2007. All songs are written and produced by myself. I started to learn some programs and composed melodies with a synthesizer (Microkorg). Over the years my music changed and I finally found what my sound should be like. I still record melodies, work a lot to find the right arrangement and add my voice. But the way how I produce my songs is basically the same: Sitting in my room, dim light, a computer and a synthesizer, some chocolate, three cats and a night that becomes a day.
Renaud Lavillenie. Lavillenie increased his best from 18' 6" to 19' 8.25" - becoming a serious threat to the 20 foot barrier. He brings his considerable skills to New York where he will go up against Tim Mack who has an identical PR set back in 2004. Add 19' 2.50" vaulter Derek Miles to the mix and we should see some very high attempts in New York.

The other conspicuous absences in my childhood were cookbooks. Indian recipes, as is well known, are usually passed down as oral traditions, or on scribbled bits of papers. Even today, I rarely see mum referring to a cookbook. She actually gets amused when I try and pin down quantities so I can write them up for the blog. Her usual method of explanation goes along the lines of 'well, add a handful of this and a pinch of that, and a spoon of this and a couple glugs on that'. Yep, helpful. Not! On ocasion I saw mum using a recipe that was found in a local weekly paper. But we never had those glossy coffee table style cookbooks that everybody seems to own now.
I was lucky my husband kept the youngest entertained, and the oldest was camping.

For many intelligent Polish people, there are only so many times you can hear that when asked what the best thing in Poland is, people reply "Polish women". Don't get me wrong, I am married to a beautiful Polish women and would happily describe Polish women to any foreigner as being the most beautiful women in the world. However, there are a few more things to Poland that it's women :)
We all had so much fun working on our very pink dress up inspiration shoot. It was (for me) the first time working with children in multiples, which could have ended up going in any direction really. It was all good, although there was a teeny petulant area when they got to the table and found out they would have to wait another three minutes before they were actually allowed to eat the pretty cakes :)
“Where are you from?” I asked. He told me he was from Turkey and what his academic interests were. He then asked me where I was from and where I went to school. I responded that I was born and raised in Norfolk, and that I went to the university in my backyard for my bachelor’s and master’s. He repeated what I said for clarification; I confirmed it; and his response was, “That’s strange.”
Running errands with the missus can be a challenge for any man, but when those errands involve a trip to Michaels it's all good. Yesterday I found a cool tower for $4.99.

As unfortunate as it may be, Jonathan Lee’s documentary is my first foray into the eccentric and powerful world of Paul Goodman. Paul Goodman Changed My Life does little more than give a basic introduction into the background of Goodman. Lee doesn’t attempt to get into the psyche of Goodman, or to justify or vilify his actions, but instead Lee documents Goodman’s life to the best of his ability. The resulting effort leaves me – a newcomer to Goodman’s work – feeling like an outsider.

So, she hovering just behind me as I’m printing. Not to be nosy, but just standing there. I’m hoping she won’t notice the company name in the label. Praying she won’t. Alas, I am not so lucky. I had already told her that I received stuff that wasn’t mine and how embarrassing it was and when she saw the label she of course started ribbing me about if it really wasn’t mine. I was utterly motified, but managed to play it off well. I was super embarrassed because if she saw it and had that reaction, how was I going to deal with it when I took it to UPS?? Thinking about it has me cringing even though I’m just returning things that were shipped to me on accident. Nothing to be embarrassed about, Girl!

For starters, no one is property, we are not owned by anyone. Second of all, women especially are not property. To me, that shows insecurity, and the fact that this kid said it the way he did, I think either he learned it from friends or his own dad. Plus, he crashed her car, she didn’t crash it, and yet he is telling her to ‘shut up’ which is the most uncalled for act he could have done besides referring to her as his ‘property.’ It wasn’t her fault, it was his, but the whole endeavor was just uncalled for
Farm Kid #2: I help with those in the garden, they make great pickles too!
The trend that "Shutter Island" seems to be chasing is what I now call the Big Twist Narrative that seems to have plagued horror films and thrillers for the last ten years. The narratives often function as a series of twists, fakeouts and gotcha moments building to an ending designed to make you slap your head and proclaim "Holy crap! I didn't see that coming!" Who knew Rod Serling would become one of the most influential writers of our time? Most would obviously point to M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" as the Ground Zero moment when filmmakers started making movies that resembled feature-length Twilight Zone episodes. I do believe that is a bit unfair, as I still consider both the Twist in "Sense" and the story that precedes it to still be justified as a narrative about human emotions. Besides, the emotional climax of that movie was always the final scene between main character Cole Sear and his mother in the car.

We went ringing at Al Ali Farm in the afternoon last weekend. I had only been ringing at this site once before and it looks like a great site. There are plenty of tall trees, shrubs and open fields and a lot of birds where about. In the trees we set three nets hoping to catch Rufous-tailed Scrub Robin and Common Redstart which were seen in good numbers as we were setting up the nets. We also hoped we could catch a few Ortolan buntings in the grass field as Brendan and Nicole had caught 21 birds there the weekend before in one attempt. As it turned out most of the Ortolan Buntings had moved on and plenty of House Sparrows were in the fields along with a number of Daurian Shrikes and Turkestan Shrikes. Abdulla came for an hour and hoped to catch a Lesser Grey Shrike that he had seen but it evaded the trap and was not caught. …

There are a few tactics used to gain subscribers. Some sites hit you with a popup as soon as you come to it, asking you to subscribe. I for one abhor these popups (to spite claims they work), because if I haven’t even read your content yet, no way am I going to start handing you my information (even tho I am sure you will respect all my privacy). Some people put content plugs in their material for subscribers (it is on the right, it says “Follow the madness.”). But I have my doubts shameless plugs will do it either.
I see in Forrest Gump the most important qualities for a man to success: faith and persistence. He firmly believes in what he is doing and does everything with his full capacity. When he was young, he was only good at was running. He also enjoyed it. So he ran at his best and got into the football team, which later led him into college. In the Vietnam war, he followed the Lieutenant faithfully and treated him sincerely, which earned him a valuable lifelong friendship. Moreover, he was able to retreat when he could not fight through. He memorized Jenny’s words well: “Never try to be brave”. When one’s in overwhelming danger, the most optimal strategy is indeed saving up one’s energy for a better future.
ABOUT THE WEBINAR
My wife and I are one of many same-sex couples who lived under a strange compromise. I'll try to recap succinctly. We married in Massachusetts on December 31, 2004. Our marriage was legally invalidated by judges because we were not residents of Massachusetts, and there was a law against letting out-of-state couples marry there if their marriage would be illegal in their home state. (The original intent of the law was to prevent interracial couples from traveling out-of-state to marry in Massachusetts, which demonstrates how intertwined all sorts of oppression are.) Then that law was overturned, and around the same time, the State of New York began to honor marriages that had been contracted *out* of state. As in, one couldn't legally marry a same-sex partner in New York, but could marry out of state. L'Ailee and I went back to Massachusetts as close as we could to our anniversary and re-married.

As for the family, They will be a family of 5 (1 son and 2 daughters) who are not nobility, but come from prosperous families who have made their fortunes in the textile and timber trades, and also investments in shipping. I'm still working on the individual members of the family and staff. Mostly they are inspired by my favorite movie characters. I've given a lot more thought to the staff then the actual family. My biggest source of information was the book "Victorian House" by Judith Flanders.
A wide covered porch off the living room steps down to a semi-circular stone terrace with direct view of the reservoir through a narrow cut in the thick stand of trees along the shore.

Good musicians are generous always, they share their gifts easily and, when they feel they are understood, they respond in ways that one might never imagine. They are great characters: huge, unpredictable, difficult, inspiring. In all my stories, including ‘Sofía the beautiful,’ these musicians are present, as the central character or, as in this case, as the chorus. My work does not permit me to write as much as I would like, but to write what I like, which is probably more important.

I live in a community of people that I’m sure want this country to be a great place to live both now and in the future for our children and grandchildren. Yet when I watch our leaders and media, the focus seems to be primarily on our political differences. Some of us believe that the risks of climate change make it the most urgent issue that we must address together. Others believe it is our economy or big government that are the urgent issues to address. I find myself disheartened and doubting that our leaders have any idea of how to change the polarized game of politics and to make meaningful progress.

I'm a much happier lady now, with my little rechargeable Dirt Devil. I've even seen Littlest using it.
Even if the flute gets the spotlight for most of the time, TAAB2 is still a progressive rock album at its core. The songs are very well glued together, complex and intricate. Overshadowed by the flute as they might be, the guitars still sound pretty bad ass and the drumming is top notch. Because Ian’s voice is not as good as it was in his youth, he turned to a more mellow, low tone pitched delivery and, frankly, that’s a good thing; it blends very well with the album, and it proves that Ian is the kind of artist that is very aware of his limits and writes his songs accordingly. He hasn’t turned soft, if that’s what you’re thinking, nor has his music suffered a decline in quality – it’s just a tad different from what he used to do and it suits him well.

When Ferguson fails to land the Belgian, because Hazard is more interested in the “project” at Manchester City, he will divert his attentions and funds in the direction of Fernando Llorente, Luka Modric, Nicolás Gaitán or Shinji Kagawa. To balance the books, the Scot will drive former goal grabbers Federico Macheda, Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Owen to somewhere deep into the countryside, tell them to get out of the car and drive off lickety-split without an ounce of guilt.

Democrats delivered for unions by exempting the first $27,500 of a straight family’s health plan from the “Cadillac tax” and delayed any taxation on those benefits until 2018. Gay individuals, parents and their children who receive their health insurance through their domestic partners pay income tax on dollar one of their benefits. This is a huge disparity in the treatment of gays and straights. It is also a hardship for middle and low-income gay families and an injustice for all gays. Lobbying to include domestic partners in the “Cadillac tax” exemption would have been smart, non-controversial and helped many in our community. Instead of making progress, by ignoring this opportunity we were left with the expansion of a discriminatory system.

In order to infuse a bit of Irish culture into our wedding, after the rehearsal dinner we decided to have a traditional seisiún (session) with a live Irish band and lots of Guinness and Irish Coffee. It was wild and we had all the guests doing ‘Riverdance’ type moves all night! The day of the wedding we rented a red double decker bus to take the wedding party and our families to and from the ceremony, it was a hit! Definitely went along with our vintage Ireland theme. We also included some traditional Irish dishes like Leek & Potato soup and Irish Smoked Salmon on the dinner menu.
On the other hand, there are those that spend an enormous amount of time in the boss’s office. Perched on the edge of their chair, a basket of freshly made muffins and a smile that even Colgate would question. They hang on every word from their beloved leaders’ mouth and pretend like they know what the heck is going on. This, my friend, is a brown noser in the making. Their competence level is strained at best, and they were hired for looks, connections or rate of speech (yes, even novices how to strategically land a job by fast talking their way into the hearts of the decision makers). I used to say this to my oldest as he was growing up. Feel free to use it. Your face will get you in the door; your heart will keep you.

Across the hallway is the fabric-covered cork board. We used a mirror that was a gift from my MIL and turned it into this corkboard. This was the first cork board I ever did and I didn’t research it very well thinking it looked pretty straightforward. But after putting it all together the tacks didn’t stay in, so in my ignorance I bought more cork board thinking it just needed another layer. They stay in a little bit better but not great. I definitely recommend cutting a piece of cardboard to put behind cork boards like we did in the office.

It must be that time of year because I know a lot of people who are in need of a get well card...everything from the stomach bug to broken bones. So I decided to use the cheerful Oops-a-Daisy set to create a simple set of Get Well cards. I started by matching up the ink colors to the Jillibean Homemade 6 Bean Soup patterned paper. I stamped the flowers in Colorbox Yellow Citrus, Maroon, Rouge, and Prima Turquoise Stone. Then I cut out the flower with the coordinating Oops-a-Daisy die. I cut ovals with the Spellbinders oval set and airbrushed inside the die line with Copics. I stamped the stem and leaves with Colorbox Lime Pastel ink and then popped the daisy up on foam tape. I wanted to keep it really simple so I just layered onto a scalloped oval and added a little ribbon to finish them off.

The weather over the past few days has been co-operating, at least some of the time, and so we’ve been able to play outside in the yard.

Rudyard Kipling achieved fame quickly, based initially on his first stories and poems written in India (he returned there after College), and his great popularity with the British public continued despite subsequent critical reaction to some of his more conservative work, and critical opinion in later years that his poetry was superficial and lacking in depth of meaning.

All of these questions will be answered on Friday, but it is freakin Tuesday right now and I have had those question going through my head for a long time now. I am not the most patient man ever.

Formal confirmation as to whether the action has been raised in England or Scotland is awaited. As I have said many times, any action should be raised in England as the financial pressures on the defender to settle are so much higher, and the “no win, no fee” provisions so much more favourable for claimants.
But not without a fight.

Counsel for the US Government went very close to arguing that TV Links was wrongly decided. In any event, Counsel sought to distinguish Mr O'Dwyer's behaviour from the restrictive decision in TVLinks. First the TVShack websites were entirely in the hands of Richard O’Dwyer and his co-conspirators, requiring third parties to sign up to TVShack and be vetted before going further. Secondly, unlike TVLinks, there was no attempt to protect copyright, as Mr O'Dwyer knew materials were subject to copyright and actively taunted already-cited efforts in June 2010 to seize TVShack.net.

I have been thinking about this for a while, and despite the fact that I enjoy intellectually sharp characters, I don't require them to continue reading. At one point I even asked myself in adversarial fashion, "What, Juliette, are you really looking for characters who are exactly at your level of intelligence and can't make mistakes?"

5. Road trip. I’ve been thinking about this one for quite some time. I don’t know how feasible this is, especially since I’ll be working full time, but I’d like to make some road trips east over a couple weekends or so. I’ve always been interested in experiencing the other parts of America (especially non-coastal states), because I feel there is a vast disconnect between coastal and non-coastal states. I would ideally get a lot of driving done on awesome roads, see lots of interesting sights, and learn new things. Not sure if I want to go it alone or bring along some friends. Friends are always fun, but I think solo trips bring in a completely different experience, which could be good for me as well. I guess we’ll see!
We did have several other children who did respond and received Christ. We praise God for those decisions! We gave away 4 new Bibles to those who brought the most visitors.

Be sure to ask your student what their experience was in giving away stuff!
Given the amount of financial stimulation that the Fed has pumped into the economy with limited apparent impact along with the recently stated willingness to do even more raises a fairly large red flag. While such action may keep interest rates artificially low, they have been at these low levels for some time with little economic improvement to show for it given the magnitude of the cash infusion. This is much like has been the case for decades in Japan. While these low rates may force savers to abandon fixed income to buy equities in search of a better return, to me this inflation of the stock market is artificial (although as the saying goes it is difficult to fight the tape).

A couple of evenings ago I watched a documentary on TV about Tony Onley. I was inspired by something that Jack Shadbolt said. It was not his words per se but the cultural attitude that he and Onley had about ‘art’ last century – specifically painting. I mused that it would be so fun if there was a daily TV show on interviewing eclectic people about art. Some interviewees could be ‘experts’ – professors of art history, painting, art criticism; some gallery owners, curators, jurists; practitioners of contemporary art; or art collectors of all stripes. Others could include exhibition opening visitors and supporters, those who have never been to a gallery or artists discussing various topics including directions in their current work. Let’s get back the passion people. Onley, Shadbolt, Wyman and others discussed painting with enthusiasm.

Good musicians are generous always, they share their gifts easily and, when they feel they are understood, they respond in ways that one might never imagine. They are great characters: huge, unpredictable, difficult, inspiring. In all my stories, including ‘Sofía the beautiful,’ these musicians are present, as the central character or, as in this case, as the chorus. My work does not permit me to write as much as I would like, but to write what I like, which is probably more important.

When some people have memories they want to save, they sometimes grab the nearest container and stick it in there. Most of the time, that's perfectly fine, too. Other people don't use containers at all-- they just stick the memories all willy-nilly on the shelves themselves, and their brains resemble a hoarder's house. AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS. Seriously, people. Using a plastic grocery bag is a million times better than just shoving the memories on the shelf.

Well, I’ll tell you the truth: it beats me! However, I’m not ashamed to admit that Stan Madeley is my kind of man: fearless when the circumstances call for it but with a dash of the romantic when his wife Sandra (54) hits the dimmer switch. He’s also the UK’s top Richard Madeley lookalike and a trained cabaret chisel thrower to boot, so you don’t need me to point out that he’s blessed on more than one front.
Penny Alesi recalls Idema's screams into the speakerphone and calling the persons on the receiving end vile names who preformed unspeakable sexual acts. Ms. Alesi and her “family” of three American cats were then living with Idema from March 31, 2009 - September 17, 2009; and was his close companion every single day. What she experienced in those months of horror will never be forgotten: Idema was constantly breaking phones, glasses, ashtrays, anything within reach because he was not happy with the way things were going in the States. However, he would not even attempt to return to America because he was afraid that the FBI had a sealed indictment that would put him in jail the moment he stepped foot on U.S. soil. Thus he would do all his business via phone, computer and fax. The problem was that Idema had broken rule number one of a successful con artist by drinking to excess and using illegal drugs like cocaine. As if wasn't enough to blow his cool, the dust to dawn bizarre sex escapades at his Casa Arabi that by themselves would have driven anyone over the edge.
I had a few auditions scheduled after I returned, one with Ballet San Jose. After the audition a trio of participants stayed to speak with the director. I felt good about my performance in the audition, and felt fortunate to speak to the Director afterward, but I'd had that feeling before. That feeling, the fluttery, suppressed nervousness, had been rewarded in the past with nothing. I waited, trying to convince myself I was waiting for nothing, or if not nothing, then at least more rejection. I was formulating plan-B's right and left. I was going to "get on with my life." The boyfriend kept talking me down.
I had never heard of the designation CODA (Child of Deaf Adult) until after I moved away from home and saw the Hallmark movie “Love is Never Silent.” In the movie, there’s a confrontational scene between the deaf parents and the hearing daughter after she’s moved away from home. During that scene, I broke down and sobbed like I’d never cried in all my life. In fact, I couldn’t even talk about that movie for a couple of years without starting to cry. I wasn’t angry with my parents. Nor do I think I had an unlucky childhood. That movie began a process which helped me learn how important it is that I embrace who I am. I am in both worlds, both deaf and hearing. My personality is different in each world. When I sign to deaf people I’m no longer shy. If I see a deaf person signing, I want to go over and introduce myself. In the hearing world, I’m much more reserved. Since then, I’ve learned to recognize that I can live in both worlds at the same time.

Note: I drew up my top 30 list several weeks ago, but have only now scribbled up some words to go with it. This means that, inevitably, some films I've seen since from the year, and that may have been included (Senna, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol etc), haven't been given a place even if they were entirely worthy. Also, some films may, in time, move up or down according to rewatches or personal opinion. This is always the way and unavoidable. But anyway, here they are (for the forseeable future, at least):
Actually, and forgive me please, but R. Kelly is almost onto something with this hip-hopera. Whether he realizes it or no, he falls into a number of the stock devices found in opera. Repetition of themed music is taken as purely coincidental until he actually starts branching out. He’s also got a villain (Pimp Luscious), clowns Rosie (LaDonna Tittle) and Randolph (Kelly), and obviously he’s got a complicated love-heptagon among characters that occasionally know each other.
It’s not the cold that peaks me to that I can attest
If violent video games were the cause for aggression in school, then there would be far more violence than we are seeing today. The truth is, despite all of the lobbying to get parental warnings on video games, the number one sellers for each year are always first person shooters. So why are we seeing an increase in emotional support schools and not an increase in violent behaviors associated with these graphic games? The answer shouldn’t surprise you. We have effectively misplaced our direction to focus on the outward sources rather than the inward struggle.

So in conclusion, my “denomination” is everything aligned with the Word. I don’t need a fancy name or a huge building with the letters nailed across it. I am a Christian who believes that Jesus is my Lord and Savior, who died on the cross, resurrected, and is coming again (1 John 4:14, John 3:16, Matthew 18:7, Matthew 16:27). In simple terms, I reject anything that is not instructed and supported by God and His Word. We are the Church and the Holy Spirit dwells within us, what other definitions do we need?
Matthew's class had a field trip out to LaFayette to the Children's Museum of Acadiana. It was just a regular children's museum - nothing specific to Acadia. And it was an expensive field trip. I wonder how families with tighter budgets than ours make this work.
Two scenes from this movie fucked me up. First of course is the snake eating scene, that even in my "hey I'll try anything you can eat once" demeanor, I can't help but gag. Top that lovely scene with the rats in the water and you'd already have a winner. But no, they weren't satisfied with that and had to go and show me how the bad guy would rip a man's living heart out only to be tossed to the fire or some other overkill that just wasn't necessary. For an adult it was obviously fake, for a kid, well let's just say that voodoo juju isn't my idea for a good betimme story.

In contrast to our weeks of no rain and dry grounds, we’ve consistently had rain pretty much for the past week now. But we’re still in a drought, of course.

Sport brings about a whole new meaning behind the value of food! I would argue that as an athlete, the preparation and consumption of food can take up to half of our entire day. I have come to appreciate the value that proper nutrition can have on body composition, performance and confidence. Two years ago, I weighed in at a rather staggering amount. I was boggled by the continual growth (bad kind of growth) on the scale week after week as I felt that my diet had an awful lot of spinach and not enough ice-cream. In September 2010, I was about 20 pounds heavier than what I targeted my ideal racing weight to be. Imagine skating, sliding, jumping, running, simply living with a 20lb sac of potatoes on your back – kinda’ an inconvenience. So with this thought in mind (and motivated by the fact that my cyclist brother (4” taller than me) weighed the same) I was determined to figure out how to mash this sac of potatoes and become a healthy, lean machine.
Happy February!

Remember that sentence about Melissa way back? “Admiringly” is an adverb that should have been cut. It tells us how to interpret her feelings instead of showing us her admiration. Here is a way to show in that scene:
It must be that time of year because I know a lot of people who are in need of a get well card...everything from the stomach bug to broken bones. So I decided to use the cheerful Oops-a-Daisy set to create a simple set of Get Well cards. I started by matching up the ink colors to the Jillibean Homemade 6 Bean Soup patterned paper. I stamped the flowers in Colorbox Yellow Citrus, Maroon, Rouge, and Prima Turquoise Stone. Then I cut out the flower with the coordinating Oops-a-Daisy die. I cut ovals with the Spellbinders oval set and airbrushed inside the die line with Copics. I stamped the stem and leaves with Colorbox Lime Pastel ink and then popped the daisy up on foam tape. I wanted to keep it really simple so I just layered onto a scalloped oval and added a little ribbon to finish them off.
So in the midst of a mining boom the idea that Australia could enter recession is a very left field call and the Reserve Bank is going to everything in its power to ensure this doesn’t happen. But with the Government tightening their belt along with the Household sector the risks are rising that for the first time in a generation Australia heads into recession.That means that rates will probably still head substantially lower and hopefully take the Australian Dollar with them.

Born Virginia Hensley and referred to by her family as “Ginny”, Patsy Cline displayed a talent for performing as early as the age of 4, when she won first prize in an amateur tap-dancing contest. It was not long afterward that she transferred her enthusiasm from dance to music, and for her eighth birthday Ginny’s mother bought a piano to provide her with a means to develop her natural musical skills. By her early teens she was singing in the choir of the family’s Baptist church and on her own at the local radio station. At the age of 13 the young girl’s life was nearly brought to end by an attack of rheumatic fever, which forced her to spend a period in an oxygen tent; she would later attribute the quality of her voice to the throat infection that resulted from her illness. Two years later her father abandoned the family and Ginny was forced to drop out of school, taking night jobs singing at clubs in addition to service jobs during the day in order to help pay the bills.
She clutched the phone to her and wept with joy. Oh yes. Hell yes. She would follow through. She would follow him to the ends of the earth. Then, startled out of her revelry, she looked at her ringing phone. It was the same number, calling. She smiled as she hit the green button….

We went ringing at Al Ali Farm in the afternoon last weekend. I had only been ringing at this site once before and it looks like a great site. There are plenty of tall trees, shrubs and open fields and a lot of birds where about. In the trees we set three nets hoping to catch Rufous-tailed Scrub Robin and Common Redstart which were seen in good numbers as we were setting up the nets. We also hoped we could catch a few Ortolan buntings in the grass field as Brendan and Nicole had caught 21 birds there the weekend before in one attempt. As it turned out most of the Ortolan Buntings had moved on and plenty of House Sparrows were in the fields along with a number of Daurian Shrikes and Turkestan Shrikes. Abdulla came for an hour and hoped to catch a Lesser Grey Shrike that he had seen but it evaded the trap and was not caught. …

After that the humorous and alliterative credits became more infrequent. Indeed, Stan often saved that for the Bullpen Bulletin or the letters page.

Hi everyone, how have you all been? A bit of a special one today... here we have a double feature post consisting of two manis using a spectraflair franken I made.

Sadly, I heard that he recently passed away. These manis are a thank you to Sid - you will be missed! Thanks for providing us with endless possibilities to create some awesome polishes and enjoy what we love! =D

TripleF and I almost never hung out alone, so I was pretty stoked one night when she texted me, asking if I wanted to go to the bar with her–just the two of us. She said she had a friend performing a song at a bar, and needed someone to go with. I had spent all Saturday morning and afternoon in the architecture design studios, and I was definitely ready for some excitement. However, the bright side of working in studio on weekends is that it is very easy to bring your alcohol in with you, which I did. By the time I left studio, I was very happily buzzed, and a couple more drinks would’ve pushed me into the “drunk” category.

What I really loved about this recipe though is that you prepare it the night before and it's all ready to go the next morning. Brilliant! I adore waffles on the weekend but sometimes I just want to sit with my coffee and relax rather than make a big breakfast. It was so nice to plug in the waffle iron and have a steamy hot fluffy waffle on my plate a few minutes later. Love this and will definitely make again!

Formal confirmation as to whether the action has been raised in England or Scotland is awaited. As I have said many times, any action should be raised in England as the financial pressures on the defender to settle are so much higher, and the “no win, no fee” provisions so much more favourable for claimants.
Ignore the people on the sides of the photo above and focus on the hunk of rock in the middle. Now you may ask yourself, “How did the Incas move that beautiful piece of stonework up the mountain?” and the answer would be, “They didn’t.”

Walt – Yes thanks Bob, good morning. Urban Land Institute presentation discussed some trends that will affect commercial real estate. One trend that is developing is “Less is Better”. Tenants and owners are beginning to squeeze more out of every square foot of space in every type of commercial space. This efficiency means less square footage, but it also is about creating environments that are multi-dimensional, adaptable and create a greater intensity of use.
At the point I started this card I hadn't ordered my distress inks, these would have probably made the distressing part easier, but I got the desired effect using chalks and a little brown ink and I also distressed the edges of the digi image and the music paper by scraping a craft knife down the edges and curling the corners.

Martha and Cynthia were left with the two thousand pound cost of flying their Aunt’s body back home for burial, in addition to the debts she had racked up in the six years of travelling. It had not been a particularly good time. Still, if she was going to go, Martha thought, she’d like to go out with a bang; like frivolous Aunt Cece, only perhaps without the yellow pallor and translucent, wrinkled skin. Martha consoled herself that she didn’t look her age, and prayed that she could at least keep her good looks until the time came.
Some people experienced quite a startle financially in 2008. Companies that had been extremely unstable for quite a while were recognized by the masses to be unstable upon the publicizing of those companies filing bankruptcy or or least nearing bankruptcy: yes US auto giants, but also mainstream financial institutions including Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, IndyMac, Countrywide, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual, and even the world’s largest insurance company, a US company that many in the US were not familiar with: AIG.

Following the guided tour we ended up back outside, in the shade under the roof of the “cafeteria” where the men share meals, prayer and reading from the Bible. Our conversation here lasted for some time and was very enjoyable and humbling.
The last large “race riot” took place in 1991 in South Central Los Angeles following the videotaped brutal beating of black motorist Rodney King and an all-white jury’s subsequent acquittal of the officers involved. Though they didn’t riot, many whites, along with the majority of blacks, felt and expressed outrage at the injustice.

The night began with what had been introduced as each third year film student describing themselves through film in 10 seconds. These may actually be my favourite part of the evening. There were Pokémon references, memes, Final Cut and rendering frustrations, and a lot of endearing moments that helped get to know the students.

At The Celebration, I attended the panel entitled "Teaching Students to Become History Detectives," featuring speakers Sandhya Nankani and Elyse Luray kicked off the panel by describing in fascinating detail her experiences as one of the five hosts of the PBS' American History series History Detectives. Once a top appraiser at Christie's auction house, Elyse has spent her years on the show using objects ranging from canons to horse saddles as the jumping off point to make amazing discoveries about U.S. history. At one point, Elyse found a piece of Amelia Earhart's airplane. At another juncture, she helped find the S.S. Portland, a sunken ship in Alaska which was the first ship that found gold there!
Before you write your book title, make a list of all related keywords and perform a search on Google to see what comes up in the results. Also, when you do your search, the first page shown should have a short list of other suggested keywords or phrases (usually at the very top or bottom of the page). Incorporating as many of these words into your book title as is possible will help your book be seen better in the future.
This book discusses the animal zodiac and tries to explain some of the different animals. Ahead of time, I check to see which year each child was born (you think they would know, but many don't!). I tell them which animal they are and we discuss some of the characteristics. They always get a kick out of this part-- and they want to know which animal their brother, sister, mama, and daddy are....

Hi! My name is Dash and I’ve had 5 months of practice writing a blog. Now that I am in a better place in my life I have decided to take a leap and start my professional blog, in which I wish to learn more about myself. This task was prescribed by my good friend Julie, on my birthday, and I feel like this is useful advice. Here I hope to dig deeper into my hobbies, interests, and whatever else I may find buried along the way, now that I can somewhat concentrate on my life.
My detour is over. I'm back on the road folks!

Rudyard Kipling achieved fame quickly, based initially on his first stories and poems written in India (he returned there after College), and his great popularity with the British public continued despite subsequent critical reaction to some of his more conservative work, and critical opinion in later years that his poetry was superficial and lacking in depth of meaning.

In contrast, to address these challenges the SNP Government have focused upon reinvigorating our economy by investing in infrastructure projects such as building new homes, roads, hospitals and investments such as the new Airdrie Health Centre. Initiatives such as these protect existing jobs and create new ones by bringing money back into the local economy and therefore supporting economic growth.

But he's also a writer of tough guy, Ludlumian fiction, with titles like The Apocalypse Directive, and America's Last Days: A Novel, and with his latest book, he's facing the same dilemma confronted by every tough guy American writer from James Fenimore Cooper to Ernest Hemingway to Norman Mailer: dismissive online reviews that seek to weaken his main character's bladder control.
I used to envy my younger brother at these times and for a number of reasons. The first being that as he always received his belting second, my dads efforts would be significantly less, having already tired out his swinging arm on me. The second, for some reason no matter how hard the punishment was and how much yelling was going on, my brother had a habit of laughing uncontrollably throughout the whole thing. I now realise that this was probably a nervous laughter, coming out of fear but at the time I just wished that I could have seen even a fracture of the humour I perceived that he was seeing. The third and probably the most valid, my brother was a naughty child, he did do things that were nasty and horrible and inexplicable. He showed no fear in his actions and if he thought something seemed like a good idea at the time, he did it. I envied the fact that even though he was being punished for his actions, at least he had the benefit of having done what he wanted and had fun doing it.

Since being practically forced into doing a bold lip everyday for work, I've fallen in love with lipstick so much that I continue to do bold lip looks on my days off! I could very easily go months without doing a bold eyeshadow look, but then my blog would be reallllly boring. Thankfully I have quite a few dramatic eye looks backlogged that I can post :)

The base is very important, too, so I suggest a Ming the Merciless vibe. That will certainly appeal to those who cheer executions and don’t care if a woman bleeds to death, because she was denied an abortion at an emergency room…
Here's a couple more altered tins. The red one is a vintage cigarette tin, and the other, well, I am not sure what it is, as it doesn't open, but it's real sweet. These both have genuine vintage photos, and text from an old book "I can do it all!" Can't we all?

Unfortunately it seems like the bed has gotten some bad reviews in regards to the quality of it but I won't be able to see what kind of quality it is until I move into my new place since I have no room to set it up and check it out now. I'm hoping everything will be OK because I'll be unable to return the bed when I move so fingers crossed!
Assemble the panini by spreading on one side of each slice of bread the olive tapenade. Place the eggplant on 4 slices on bread. Top that with tomato, roasted red bell pepper and mozzarella cheese and top the 4 slices with the other bread tapenade side down. Lightly brush bread with olive oil and place on grill or panini press until golden.

Rea: Your first relationships are often the most intense and impressionable of your life. You’re not yet bombarded with paying bills or having a steady job – you can enjoy each other – you can focus on your feelings and not much else. As we grow older, this is what we often lose sight of: each other. This book reminds you of what’s important at any stage in relationships – focusing on what you appreciate about the person, not what annoys you.

Hola from Peru! We are the May Peru trip leaders Jess and Holly. We have had an incredible first few days and are excited to have started placements. We have had the wonderful opportunity of being able to watch the participants experience new relationships, new opportunities, and immerse themselves in the Peruvian culture. This week we are working on the construction of a daycare in Pacifico de Villa, as well as assisting at Laura Alva Saldana; a school for children with exceptionalities, and teaching English to children at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey schools. I (Jess) have been working at Laura Alva Saldana with four participants, where I would assist them with communicating with the teachers and students. While I (Holly) have been working at Juan Pablo and Cristo Rey, assisting participants as they teach children English at the primary and secondary level. We would like to turn it over to a few of our participants, as they will be sharing some of their experiences this week. We encourage you to follow along with us on our amazing journey.

I once read an interview with a woman who owns a prominent cookie company. The interviewer asked her how she stays so fit, being she's around cookies all day. Her answer? If it wasn't the best cookie she's ever put in her mouth, why would she take another bite? Why not just find the cookie she's really craving and spend her allotted calories on a truly delicious experience?

He would win true acclaim and popularity, however, as the city's district attorney proper, serving first from 1853-1859 and again from 1861-1869, one of New York's most important legal voices during the Civil War. He allegedly prosecuted over 12,000 cases. He was also on hand during the Draft Riots, funneling many rioters through the court system and straight to jail. His accomplice was often judge John Hoffman, soon to be the mayor of New York who preceded Hall. Their crusades against rioters would boost both their popularity.

Using a semi-permanent pink color + warm water we created 3 different strength pinks in 3 different bowls. (We used Special FX color in Atomic Pink. Put 2 quarter sized dabs of color in each bowl. Add 1/2 a cup of warm water to one bowl, 1 cup of warm water to the second bowl and 1 1/2 cups of warm water to the third bowl.)
Max Tegmark, astrophysicist, cosmologist and professor in the physics faculty at MIT in Cambridge, Mass likes the idea of parallel universes: the quantum mechanics (QM) paradox of a particle’s ability to be in two places at the same time. He sees mathematics as our ultimate connection to reality. “Math is not something we invented, but something we are continually rediscovering.”
